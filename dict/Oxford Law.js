"abandonment":
[['', [['n. 1. The act of giving up a legal right, particularly a right of ownership of property. Property that has been abandoned is res nullius (a thing belonging to no one), and a person taking possession of it therefore acquires a lawful title. An item is regarded as abandoned when it can be established that the original owner has discarded it and is indifferent as to what becomes of it: such an item cannot be the subject of a theft charge. However, property placed by its owner in a dustbin is not abandoned, having been placed there for the purpose of being collected as refuse. In marine insurance, abandonment is the surrender of all rights to a ship or cargo in a case of constructive total loss. The insured person must do this by giving the insurer within a reasonable time a notice of abandonment, by which he relinquishes all his rights to the ship or cargo to the insurer and can treat the loss as if it were an actual total loss.', '2. In civil litigation, the relinquishing of the whole or part of the claim made in an action or of an appeal. Any claim is now considered to be abandoned once a notice of discontinuance is served, according to rule 38 (1) of the Civil Procedure Rules.', '3. The offence of a parent or guardian leaving a child under the age of 16 to its fate. A child is not regarded as abandoned if the parent knows and approves steps someone else is taking to look after it. The court may allow a child to be adopted without the consent of its parents if they are guilty of abandonment.']]]],
"abatement":
[['', [["n. 1. (of debts) The proportionate reduction in the payment of debts that takes place if a person's assets are insufficient to settle with his creditors in full.", "2. (of legacies) The reduction or cancellation of legacies when the estate is insufficient to cover all the legacies provided for in the will or on intestacy after payment of the deceased's debts. The Administration of Estates Act 1925 provides that general legacies, unless given to satisfy a debt or for other consideration, abate in proportion to the amounts of those legacies; specific and demonstrative legacies then abate if the estate is still insufficient to pay all debts, and a demonstrative legacy also abates if the specified fund is insufficient to cover it. For example, A's estate may comprise a painting, ￡300 in his savings account, and ￡700 in other money; there are debts of ￡100 but his will leaves the painting to B,￡500 from the savings account to C. ￡800 to D, and ￡200 to E. B will receive the painting, C's demonstrative legacy abates to ￡300, and after the debts are paid from the remaining ￡700, D's and E's general legacies abate proportionately, to ￡480 and ￡120 respectively. When annuities are given by the will, the general rule is that they are valued at the date of the testator's death, then abate proportionately in accordance with that valuation, and each annuitant receives the abated sum. All these rules are subject to any contrary intention being expressed in the will.", '3. (in land law) Any reduction or cancellation of money payable. For example a lease may provide for an abatement of rent in certain circumstances, e.g. if the building is destroyed by fire, and a purchaser of land may claim an abatement of the price if the seller can prove his ownership of only part of the land he contracted to sell.', '4. (of nuisances) The termination, removal, or destruction of a nuisance. A person injured by a nuisance has a right to abate it. In doing so, he must not do more damage than is necessary and, if removal of the nuisance requires entry on to the property from which it emanates, he may have to give notice to the wrongdoer. A local authority can issue an abatement notice to control statutory nuisances.', '5. (of proceedings) The termination of civil proceedings by operation of law, caused by a change of interest or status (e.g. bankruptcy or death) of one of the parties after the start but before the completion of the proceedings. An abatement did not prevent either of the parties from bringing fresh proceedings in respect of the same cause of action. Pleas in abatement have been abolished; in modern practice any change of interest or status of the parties does not affect the validity of the proceedings, provided that the cause of action survives.']]]],
"abduction":
[['', [['n. The offence of taking an unmarried girl under the age of 16 from the possession of her parents or guardians against their will. It is no defence that the girl looked and acted as if she was over 16 or that she was a willing party. No sexual motive has to be proved. It is also an offence to abduct an unmarried girl under the age of 18 or a mentally defective woman (married or unmarried) for the purpose of unlawful sexual intercourse. In this case a defendant can plead that he had reasonable grounds for believing that the girl was over 18, or that he did not know the woman was mentally defective, respectively. It is also an offence to abduct any woman with the intention that she should marry or have unlawful sexual intercourse with someone, if it is done by force or for the sake of her property. It is also an offence for a parent or guardian of a child under 16 to take or send him out of the UKwithout the consent of the other parent or guardians. Belief that the other person has or would have consented is a defence. It is also an offence for any other person to remove or keep such a child, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, from the person with lawful control of him. Proof of belief that the child was 16 is a defence here. See also KIDNAPPING.']]]],

"abortion":
[['', [['n. The termination of a pregnancy: a miscarriage or the premature expulsion of a foetus from the womb before the normal period of gestation is complete. It is an offence to induce or attempt to induce an abortion unless the terms of the Abortion Act 1967and the Abortion Regulations 1991 are complied with. The pregnancy can only be terminated by a registered medical practitioner, and two registered medical practitioners must agree that it is necessary, for example because(1) continuation of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant woman (or of other children of hers) that is greater than the risk of terminating the pregnancy, or (2) that there is a substantial risk that the child will be born with a serious physical or mental handicap. However, doctors are not obliged to perform abortions if they can prove that they have a conscientious objection to so doing. A husband cannot prevent his wife having a legal abortion if she so wishes. Compare CHILD DESTRUCTION.']]]],

Absolute rights include freedom of thought, conscience, and religion and the prohibitions on torture, inhuman treatment or punishment, and degrading treatment or punishment. Compare QUALIFIED RIGHT.']]]],
"absolute title":
[['', [['Ownership of a legal estate in registered land with a guarantee by the state that no one has a better right to that estate. An absolute title to freehold land is equivalent to an estate in fee simple in possession in unregistered land. Absolute leasehold title, unlike good leasehold title, guarantees that the lessor has title to grant the lease. (Com pare POSSESSORY TITLE; QUALIFIED TITLE.) The title may be subject to (1) encumbrances and other entries noted on the register by means of substantive registration (e.g.a registered legal charge or land charge); (2)minor interests, such as that of a beneficiary under a trust, which may be protected by means of "entry" on the register rather than by substantive registration; and (3) overriding interests (which by their nature do not appear on the register and must be ascertained by search and enquiry). See also LAND REGISTRATION.']]]],
"abstract of title":
[['', [["Written details of the title deeds and documents that prove an owner's right to dispose of his land or an interest in this. An abstract generally deals only with the legal estate and any equitable interests that are not overreached. An owner usually supplies an abstract of title before completion to an intending purchaser or mortgagee, who compares it with the original title deeds when these are produced or handed over on completion of the transaction. An abstract of title to registered land consists of office copies of the entries in the register (together with an authority to inspect the register) and details of any other documents necessary to prove the owner's title, such as a marriage certificate proving a woman's change of surname. For unregistered land, the abstract of title must usually trace the history of the land's ownership from a document at least 15 years old (the root of title) and give details of any document creating encumbrances to which the land is subject. An abstract of title formerly comprised extracts, often in abbreviated note form, but now generally comprises duplicate copies of the relevant documents (an epitome of title). An abstract or epitome, with each copy document marked as examined against the original, may be sufficient in itself to deduce title; for instance, when a title is split into lots, the purchaser of each lot may be required to accept an examined abstract or epitome in lieu of the original title deeds, accompanied by an acknowledgment and undertaking."]]]],
"abstracting electricity":
[['', [["The arrestable offence, punishable with up to five years' imprisonment and/or a fine, of dishonestly using, wasting, or diverting electricity. This offence may be committed by someone who bypasses his electricity meter or reconnects a disconnected meter or who unlawfully obtains a free telephone call (though there is a more specific and potentially less serious offence to deal with this). Bypassing a gas or water meter could constitute theft of the gas or water. Joyriding in a lift (or some similar abuse) might also constitute wasting electricity. Computer hackers were formerly charged with offences of abstracting electricity until the Computer Misuse Act 1990made hacking a specific criminal offence."]]]],
"abstraction of water":
[['', [['The taking of water from a river or other source of supply. It normally requires a water authority licence but there are exceptions; for example when less than 1000 gallons are taken, when the water is for domestic or agricultural use (excluding spray irrigation), or when it is removed in the course of fire-fighting or land drainage. It has been held not to include gravitational loss from a canal replacing water drawn from a connecting outfall channel.']]]],

The European Commission and the Office of Fair Trading can fine businesses up to 10%of annual worldwide turnover for breach of Article 82. The record individual fine, of 102M ECUs(now euros), was against Volkswagen in 1998; it was upheld on appeal in July 2000.Under the UK Competition Act 1998a ￡3.21M penalty was imposed on Napp Pharmaceuticals.

In its conciliation function it may intervene, with or without the parties' consent. In a trade dispute to offer facilities and assistance in negotiating a settlement. It employs conciliation officers who may assist parties to an application to an employment tribunal to reach a settlement. Earlier legislation removed the necessity for binding settlements of employment disputes to involve an ACAS conciliation officer: settlements can now be made when the invididual has had independent legal advice from a qualified lawyer. ACAS does not itself arbitrate in trade disputes, but with the consent of both parties it may refer a dispute to the Central Arbitration Committee or to an independent arbitrator. ACAS may give free advice to employers, employees, and their respective representatives on matters of employment or industrial relations. It issues codes of practice giving guidance on such matters as disciplinary procedures and disclosure of information to trade unions. It may also conduct inquiries into industrial relations problems, either generally or in relation to particular businesses, and publish the results after considering the views of parties directly affected. ACAS can charge for its services when it considers that this is appropriate. The law on conciliation generally is contained in the Employment Tribunals Act 1996."]]]],
"acceleration":
[['', [["n. The coming into possession of a future interest in any property at an earlier stage than that directed by the transaction or settlement that created the interest. For example, a landlord's interest in reversion is accelerated if the tenant surrenders the lease before it has expired. When a will bequeaths an interest for life that lapses (e.g. because the legatee dies before the testator), the interest of the person entitled in remainder is accelerated and takes effect immediately the testator dies."]]]],
"acceptance":
[['', [["n. Agreement to the terms of an offer that, provided certain other requirements are fulfilled. converts the offer into a legally binding contract. If the method by which acceptance is to be signified is indicated by the offeror, that method alone will be effective. If it is not, acceptance may be either express (by word of mouth or in writing) or inferred from the offeree's conduct; for example, if he receives goods on approval and starts to make use of them. The acceptance must always, however, involve some action on the part of the person to whom the offer was made: the offeror cannot assert that his offer will be treated as accepted unless the offeree rejects it. The validity of an acceptance is governed by four principal rules. (1) It must take place while the offer is still in force, i.e. before it has lapsed (see LAPSE OF OFFER) or been revoked (see REVOCATION OF OFFER). (2)It must be on the same terms as the offer. An acceptance made subject to any variation is treated as a counteroffer. (3) It must be unconditional, thus an acceptance subject to contract is not a valid acceptance. (4) It must be communicated to the offeror. Acceptance by letter is treated as communicated when the letter is posted, but telex is equated with the telephone, so that communication takes place only on receipt. However, when the offer consists of a promise to confer a benefit on whoever may perform a specified act, the offeror waives the requirement of communication as a separate act. If, for example, he offers a reward for information, a person able to supply the information is not expected to accept the offer formally. The act of giving the information itself constitutes the acceptance. the communication of the acceptance, and the performance of the contract."]]]],

"Act of Parliament":
[['statute', [["A document that sets out legal rules and has (normally) been passed by both Houses of Parliament in the form of a Bill and agreed to by the Crown (see ROYAL ASSENT). Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, however, passing of public Bills by the House of Lords can be dispensed with, except in the case of Bills to extend the duration of Parliament or to confirm provisional orders. Subject to these exceptions, the Lords can delay Bills passed by the House of Commons; it cannot block them completely. If the Commons pass a money Bill (for example, one giving effect to the Budget) and the Lords do not pass it unaltered within one month, it may be submitted direct for the royal assent. Any other Bill may receive the royal assent without being passed by the Lords if the Commons pass it in two consecutive sessions and at least one year elapses between its second reading in the first session and its third reading in the second. Every modern Act of Parliament begins with a long title, which summarizes its aims, and ends with a short title, by which it may be cited in any other document. The short title includes the calendar year in which the Act receives the royal assent (e.g. The Competition Act 1998). An alternative method of citation is by the calendar year together with the Chapter number allotted to the Act on receiving the assent or, in the case of an Act earlier than 1963, by its regnal year or years and Chapter number. Regnal years are numbered from the date of a sovereign's accession to the throne, and an Act is attributed to the year or years covering the session in which it receives the royal assent. (See alsoENACTING WORDS.) An Act comes into force on the date of royal assent unless it specifies a different date or provides for the date to be fixed by ministerial order. Acts of Parliament are classified by the Queen's Printer as public general Acts, local Acts, and personal Acts. Public general Acts include all Acts (except those confirming provisional orders) introduced into Parliament as public Bills. LocalActs comprise all Acts introduced as private Bills and confined in operation to a particular area, together with Acts confirming provisional orders. Personal Acts are Acts introduced as private Bills and applying to private individuals or estates. Acts are alternatively classified as public Acts or private Acts according to their status in courts of law. A public Act is judicially noticed (i.e. accepted by the courts as a matter of general knowledge). A private Act is not, and must be expressly pleaded by the person relying on it. All Acts since 1850are public unless they specifically provide otherwise.

"adoption":
[['', [['n. 1. The process by which a parent\'s legal rights and duties in respect of an unmarried minor are transferred to another person or persons. Adoption can only take place by means of an adoption order made by a magistrates\' court (in the family proceedings court), county court, or the High Court (in the Children Branch of the Family Division). Adoption differs from fostering in that it affects all the parents\' rights and duties and it is a permanent change. After adoption the natural parents are (except for the rules relating to affinityand incest) no longer considered in law to be the parents of the child, who is henceforth regarded as the legal child of the adoptive parents (see alsoADOPTIVE RELATIONSHIP). However, the court may make a contact order (see SECTION 8 ORDERS) at the time the adoption order is made. Contact after adoption is becoming a contentious issue and recently the court has allowed a natural parent to seek permission to apply for a contact order in respect of an adopted child. The first (but not the only) consideration in deciding whether or not a child should be adopted is whether the adoption would safeguard and promote the welfare of the child. The court must, if possible, try to ascertain the child\'s wishes and in addition take account of all the circumstances. This may involve consulting expert opinion (e.g. of psychiatrists or social workers). The court may also appoint a "children\'s guardian to act in the child\'s interests. There are many provisions in the Adoption Act 1976 as amended by the Children Act 1989 designed to make sure that an adoption would be in the child\'s best interests. Every local authority must set up an adoption service, and adoption societies are carefully controlled; in addition, the government is anxious to increase the adoption of children who are currently in the care of the local authority. There are rules as to who may adopt and who may be adopted and provisions for a probationary period, during which the child lives with the would-be adopter(s) and the court assesses whether he gets on well with them. One of the ways in which a commissioning couple may attain the legal status of parents in relation to a child born to a surrogate mother is by adopting the child; however, this is becoming less common now that the couple can apply for a section 30 order (parental order) under the Human Embryology and Fertilization Act 1990. See SURROGACY; HUMAN ASSISTED REPRODUCTION. Normally a child cannot be adopted without the consent of each of its parents or guardians, but in some cases the court may make an adoption order without the parents\' consent (e.g. if they cannot be found or have ill-treated the child). If the court thinks that the parents are refusing unreasonably to agree to an adoption that would be in the child\'s best interests, it may make an adoption order against the parents\' wishes. A parent may consent either to a specific adoption or to an order freeing for adoption by whomever the court eventually decides is best suited to adopt the child. Since the Children Act 1989 the courts now have the option of making a section 8 order either instead of an adoption order, so that parental responsibility may be shared (e.g.a residence order), or in addition to it (e.g.a contact order). Adoption law is currently under review and there are recommendations to make it a duty of the court, when considering whether to make an adoption order, to consider alternative orders available under the Children Act, and to bring adoption law in line with the principles of the Act by making the child\'s welfare of paramount importance in adoption proceedings. In addition, a court will be able to dispense with parental consent if the welfare of the child demands this. The Registrar General must keep a register containing details of all adoption orders, which any member of the public may consult. An adopted child over the age of 18 has a right to see a copy of his original birth certificate in order to find out who his natural parents are. Although natural parents can register their interest in contacting their children who have been adopted, they have no corresponding right to trace these adopted children.', '2. Reliance by a court on a rule of international law that has not been expressly made part of the law of the land but is not inconsistent with it.', '3. The decision of a local authority or similar body to bring into force in their area an Act of Parliament conferring powers on them at their option.']]]],

The presumption of advancement arises when a father or other person in the position of a parent purchases property for a child. The presumption does not automatically arise in the case of a mother because until 1882 a married woman could not, during marriage, own property; her automatic exclusion from the presumption now seems nonsensical (especially as a mother now has a statutory duty to maintain her children), although she will in many cases be found to be "in the position of a parent". A similar presumption has been held to exist when a husband purchases property for his wife (though not vice versa), and occasionally a man for his mistress, but the strength (and perhaps even the existence) of this presumption is doubtful. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that advancement was not intended. This evidence may be parol evidence (i.e. given orally).']]]],

A protected intending occupier includes a purchaser, someone let in by the local authority, Housing Corporation, or a housing association with written evidence of his claim to the premises, or someone holding a lease, tenancy, or licence with two years to run. Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, such a person may obtain an interim possession order. This differs from an ordinary possession order in that it is much quicker, may be heard in the absence of those on the property, and involves the police in enforcement. It is only available for buildings and ancillary land and not against those, such as gypsies and New Age Travellers, who occupy open land. Once the proper procedure has been followed and the applicant has shown a good case for possession, an order will require those on the land to leave within 24 hours. Remaining on the premises or re-entry within 12'], ["months is a summary offence, punishable by a fine on level 5 and/or six months' imprisonment. A uniformed constable has a power of arrest, It is also an offence to make false or misleading statements in making or resisting such an order. Similar penalties apply on summary conviction, but on indictment a maximum of two years' imprisonment and/or a fine may be imposed. Usually it is a summary offence for a stranger or the landlord to use violence to gain entry to premises when it is known that there is someone on those premises opposed to such an entry. However, a displaced residential occupier or a protected intending occupier who has asked the person to leave may call on the police for assistance. A police constable may arrest anyone who refuses to leave for the summary offence of adverse occupation of residential premises.

After 12 years' adverse possession, the original owner's title becomes statute-barred by the Limitation Act 1980,and he cannot recover his land from the adverse possessor. The adverse possessor becomes the lawful owner (a squatter's title), and is entitled to be registered as such.

If an agent discloses his principal's name (or at least the existence of a principal) to the third party with whom he is dealing, the agent himself is not normally entitled to the benefit of, or be liable on, the contract. An undisclosedprincipal is one whose existence is not revealed by the agent to a third party; he may still be entitled to the benefit of, and be liable on, the contract, but in such cases the agent is also entitled and liable. However, an undisclosed principal may not be entitled to the benefit of a contract if the agency is inconsistent with the terms of the contract or if the third party shows that he wished to contract with the agent personally. A general agent is one who has authority to act for his principal in all his business of a particular kind, or who acts for the principal in the course of his (the agent provocateur 20 21 agricultural land tribunal agent's) usual business or profession. A special agent is authorized to act only for a special purpose that is not in the ordinary course of the agent's business or profession. The principal of a general agent is bound by acts of the agent that are incidental to the ordinary conduct of the agent's business or the effective performance of his duties, even if the principal has imposed limitations on the agent's authority. But in the case of a special agent, the principal is not bound by acts that are not within the authority conferred. In either case, the principal may ratify an unauthorized contract. An agent for the sale of goods sometimes agrees to protect his principal against the risk of the buyer's insolvency. He does this by undertaking liability for the unjustifiable failure of the third-party buyer to pay the price of the goods. Such an agent is called a del credere agent.

The Resolution lists examples of aggression, which include the following. (1) Invasion, attack, military occupation, or annexation of the territory of any state by the armed forces of another state. (2) Bombardment or the use of any weapons by a state against another state's territory. (3) Armed blockade by a state of another state's ports or coasts. (4)The use of a state's armed forces in another state in breach of the terms of the agreement on which they were allowed into that state. (5) Allowing one's territory to be placed at the disposal of another state, to be used by that state for committing an act of aggression against a third state. (6)Sending armed bands or guerrillas to carry out armed raids on another state that are grave enough to amount to any of the above acts. The first use of armed force by a state in contravention of the UN Charter is prima facie evidence of aggression, although the final decision in such cases is left to the Security Council, who may also classify other acts as aggression. The Resolution declares that no consideration whatsoever can justify aggression, that territory cannot be acquired by acts of aggression, and that wars of aggression constitute a crime against international peace.

In English law and international law, the ownership of land includes ownership of the airspace above it, by application of the maxim cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum (whose is the soil, his it is even to heaven); outer space, however, is not considered to be subject to ownership. In English law an owner has rights in as much of the airspace above his land as is necessary for the ordinary use of his land and the structures on it. Within these limits a projection over one's land (such as a signboard) can be a trespass and pollution of air by one's neighbour can be a nuisance. Pollution of air is also controlled by various statutes. There is no natural right to the free flow of air from neighbouring land, but easements for the flow of air through a defined opening (such as a window or a ventilator) can be acquired. Civil aircraft flying at a reasonable height over land do not commit trespass, but damages can be obtained if material loss or damage is caused to people or property. In international law, national airspace, including airspace above the internal waters and the territorial sea, is under complete and exclusive sovereignty of the subjacent state. As a result, apart from aircraft in distress, any use of national airspace by non-national aircraft requires the official consent of the state concerned. This can be granted unilaterally or more commonly (in respect of commercial flights) through a bilateral treaty, usually on conditions of reciprocity. See TERRITORIAL WATERS."]]]],

[['', [['n. A change that, when made in a legal document, may affect its validity. An alteration in a will is presumed to have been made after execution and will therefore be invalid.

If the alteration is duly attested by the testator and the witnesses placing their initials or signatures by it, it is presumed to be valid. If an invalid alteration completely obliterates the original words, it is treated as a blank space. If the original words can still be read, they remain effective. Alterations in deeds are presumed to have been made before execution. Alterations made after execution do not affect the validity of the deed If their purpose IS to correct an obvious error.

"ambiguity":
[['', [['n. Uncertainty in meaning. In legal documents ambiguity may be patent or latent. A patent ambiguity is obvious to anyone looking at the document; for example, when a blank space IS left for a name. A latent ambiguity at first appears to be an unambiguous statement, but the ambiguity becomes apparent in the light of knowledge gamed other than from the document. An example is "I give my gold watch to X", when the testator has two gold watches. In general, extrinsic evidence can be used to clarify latent ambiguities, but not patent ambiguities. Extrinsic evidence cannot be used to give a different meaning to words capable of ordinary interpretation.']]]],

The Civil Procedure Rules make clear that amendments may be allowed (1) with the consent of all parties, (2)with the permission of the court, or (3) in the absence of consent and without the court's permission, provided the amendment is made before the claim is served.

The latter may also pay a third party to take over his obligation to discharge a debt or to undertake any similar activity concerned with its liquidation. Debt counselling is the giving of advice (other than by the original creditor and certain others) to debtors or hirers about the liquidation of debts due under consumer-credit agreements or consumerhire agreements. In debt collecting, someone other than the creditor takes steps to procure the payment of debts owing to him. A creditor may engage a debt collector for this purpose.

In the Queen's Bench Divisional Court, appeals may be heard, when circumstances demand, from the magistrates' courts, the Crown Court, and various tribunals by way of case stated and in matters of judicial review and habeas corpus. The Court of Appeal (Civil Division) is able to hear appeals from the county courts (except in bankruptcy cases) by way of the leapfrog procedure (Court of Appeal), and appeals from the High Court and various tribunals. The House of Lords will hear appeals primarily from the Court of Appeal but can hear appeals from the High Court under the leapfrog procedure (House of Lords)."]]]],

"arbitration":
[['', [['n. The determination of a dispute by one or more independent third parties (the arbitrators) rather than by a court. Arbitrators are appointed by the parties in accordance with the terms of the arbitration agreement or in default by a court. An arbitrator is bound to apply the law accurately but may in general adopt whatever procedure he chooses and is not bound by the exclusionary rules of the law of evidence; he must, however, conform to the rules of natural justice. In English law, arbitrators are subject to extensive control by the courts, with respect to both the manner in which the arbitration is conducted and the correctness of the law that the arbitrators have applied, although this control was loosened to some extent by the Arbitration Act 1996. The judgment of an arbitrator is called his award, which can be the subject of an appeal to the High Court on a question of law under the provisions of the Arbitration Act 1996.A 1979Arbitration Act abolished the old special case procedure. In some types of arbitration it is the practice for both parties to appoint an arbitrator. If the arbitrators fail to agree about the matter in dispute, they will appoint an umpire, who has the casting vote in making the award. English courts attach great importance to arbitration and will normally stay an action brought in the courts in breach of a binding arbitration agreement. See also ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. The modern origins of international arbitration can be traced to the Jay Treaty (1784) between the USA and the UK, which provided for the determination of legal disputes between states by mixed commissions. The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 contained rules of arbitration that have now become part of customary international law. The 1899 Conventions created the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which was not strictly speaking a court but a means of providing a body of arbitrators on which the parties to a dispute could draw. Consent to arbitration by a state can be given in three ways: (1) by inclusion of a special arbitration clause in a treaty; (2) by a general treaty of arbitration, which arranges arbitration procedures for future disputes; and (3)by a special arbitration treaty designed for a current dispute.']]]],

In some cases the constable must have a warrant of arrest signed by a magistrate, which must be shown to the accused (though not necessarily at the time of arrest). However, a warrant is not required for arrestable offences. Further, a constable who reasonably suspects that a nonarrestable offence has been or is being committed may arrest the suspect if (1) he thinks that service of a summons is impracticable or inappropriate because a "general arrest condition" is satisfied (for example, if he reasonably believes that arrest is necessary to prevent the suspect causing injury) or (2) he has specific statutory power to make the arrest without warrant (e.g. for drunken driving or soliciting) or common-law power (see BREACH OF THE PEACE). When an arrest is made, the accused must be told that he is being arrested and given the ground for his arrest. A policeman has power to search the person he is arresting for any property that may be used in evidence against him. Anyone making or assisting in an arrest may use as much force as reasonable in the circumstances. Resisting lawful arrest may involve the crime of assault or obstructing a police officer. A person who believes he has been wrongfully arrested may petition for habeas corpus and may sue the person who arrested him for false imprisonment. See also BAIL; CAUTION; DETENTION; REMAND.']]]],

Article 82 only prohibits such conduct if the business is dominant, i.e. if it enjoys a market share of 40% or more in the EU (or a substantial part of it).

Before the introduction of the Civil Procedure Rules in 1999, this was called taxation of costs. Assessments may be summary or detailed. In a summary assessment, the court determines the amount payable immediately at the end of the hearing. In this instance, the court can call for whatever evidence is available at the time (e.g. brief fee) to determine the amount. This is the preferred method of assessment in fast track trials. In contrast, a detailed assessment involves the quantification of costs to a costs officer, who considers the amount at some stage after the hearing. Detailed assessments are mostly carried out by district judges in the county courts but there is a dedicated office, the Supreme Court Costs Office, for the High Court.']]]],
"assessor":

Assessors will not give oral evidence and will not be open to cross-examination or questioning.

In respect of a natural person who is deceased, assets comprise all real and personal property that forms part of the deceased's estate and is available for the payment of the deceased's debts and liabilities. See also FAMILY ASSETS; WASTING ASSETS."]]]],
"assignee":
[['', [['n. See ASSIGNMENT.']]]],
"assignment":
[['', [["n. 1. The transfer of a chose in action by one person (the assignor) to another (the assignee).By the rules of the common law, this was not permissible. If, for example, A was owed a contract debt by B, he could not transfer his right to C so as to enable C to sue B for the money owed. The assignment of certain chooses in action is now authorized and governed by particular statutes. For example, the Companies Act 1985 allows shares in a company to be transferred in the manner prescribed by the company's articles of association. These, however, are special cases; in general, chooses in action, whether legal (e.g. the benefit of a contract) or equitable (e.g. a right under a trust), can be transferred either by equitable assignment or, under the Law of Property Act 1925,by statutory assignment. For an equitable assignment, no formality is required. It is sufficient that the assignor shows a clear intention to transfer ownership of his right to the assignee. If, however, it is a legal chose that is assigned, the assignor must be made a party to any proceedings by the assignee to enforce the right. In the above example, C can sue B for the debt, but he must join A as co-claimant or (if A refuses to lend his name to the action in this way) as co-defendant. A statutory assignment under the Law of Property Act 1925 is sometimes referred to as a legal assignment, but since it may relate to an equitable chose in action as well as a legal one this is not wholly accurate. It enables the assignee to enforce the right assigned in his own name and without joining the assignor to the proceedings even if it is a legal chose. There are three requirements for its validity: it must be absolute; it must be in writing; and written notice of it must be given to the person against whom the right is enforceable. For these purposes, an absolute assignment is one that transfers the assignor's entire interest to the assignee unconditionally. If less than his entire interest (e.g. part of a debt) is transferred, or if any condition is attached to the transfer (e.g. that the consent of a third party be obtained), the assignment is not absolute. An assignment need not, however, be permanent to be absolute, and this is exemplified by the mortgage of a chose in action. If A, who owes money to C, assigns to C as security for that debt a debt due to him from B,with the proviso that C will reassign the debt if A settles what is due to him, the assignment is absolute despite the proviso for reassignment. The assignment of contractual rights (which must be distinguished from novation) is subject to certain restrictions. For reasons of public policy, the holder of a public office must not assign his salary nor a wife her right to maintenance payments awarded in matrimonial proceedings. Rights to the performance of personal services, as under contracts of employment, are also incapable of being assigned. Intellectual property rights must be assigned or transferred by document in writing signed by the assignor. Stamp duty is payable on assignments of property if the value transferred is over ￡60,000.", "2. The transfer of the whole of the remainder of the term of a lease. A tenant may assign his lease unless there is a covenant against it: there is often a covenant against assignment without the landlord's consent. The landlord cannot charge a fee for giving his consent unless there is express provision for this in the lease and he may not withhold his consent unreasonably. Less commonly, a lease may contain a covenant that prohibits any assignment at all. Where a lease contains a covenant against assigning without the landlord's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, the landlord has certain statutory duties. These are: he must give the tenant notice of his decision within a reasonable time of the tenant requesting consent; the notice must give reasons for any refusal of consent, or conditions attached to acceptance (the conditions themselves must not be unreasonable); and the landlord cannot withhold consent unless the tenant would be in breach of covenant if he completed the transaction without consent.

"assured shorthold tenancy":
[['', [["A special kind of assured tenancy at the end of which the landlord is entitled to recover possession without having to show one of the usual grounds for possession of an assured tenancy. This kind of tenancy was introduced by the Housing Act 1988,replacing protected shorthold tenancies. Under the 1988 Act the landlord was obliged to give the tenant notice before the grant of the tenancy that it was an assured shorthold tenancy. However, under the Housing Act 1996,from 28 February 1997the requirement for the landlord to serve a notice is removed, and all new tenancies are automatically assured shortholds unless otherwise agreed. If a landlord wants to give the tenant security under an assured tenancy, this must be specifically created; if this is not done, the tenancy is an assured shorthold without security of tenure. A tenant can apply to a rent assessment committee if he thinks the rent of the tenancy is excessive. The committee can fix a new rent if they think that the rent is significantly higher than that of other assured tenancies in the area. However, government regulations may restrict this right in certain areas or in certain circumstances. The landlord may obtain possession at any time when he would have been entitled to do so contractually, by giving two months' notice and specifying that the tenancy is an assured shorthold tenancy. No order for possession may be made in the first six months of the tenancy."]]]],
"assured tenancy":
[['', [["A form of tenancy under the Housing Act 1988 that is at a market rent but gives security of tenure. The premises may be furnished or unfurnished. This kind of tenancy replaces protected tenancies except those in existence before the Housing Act 1988 came into force. Former assured tenancies under the Housing Act 1980(where different provisions applied) are converted into the new kind of assured tenancy. To qualify as an assured tenancy, the premises must be let as a separate dwelling, within certain rateable value limits. There are certain exceptions, such as when the landlord lives in another part of the same premises. Under the Housing Act 1996, from 28 February 1997all new residential tenancies are assured shorthold tenancies without security of tenure, unless a notice is specifically served stating that the parties are creating an assured tenancy. The rent is an open market rent agreed between the landlord and tenant, and it is not registered. However, the landlord must give the tenant notice if he intends to increase the rent, and the tenant can then apply to a rent assessment committee if he thinks the increase is excessive. The rent assessment committee determines the rent at the current market value. There are limits on the frequency of rent increases. The landlord can only regain possession on certain statutory grounds. These include: nonpayment of rent; that the landlord formerly lived in the dwelling and requires it again for his own use; that the tenant is a nuisance neighbour or may become a nuisance; and that alternative accommodation is available (the court has discretion in this last case). When the tenant of an assured tenancy dies, his spouse has a right, in certain circumstances, to take over the tenancy as successor to the deceased tenant.

If the company has issued 10000 of these shares, it is said to have an issued capital of ￡10,000 and retains the ability, without an increase in capital (see ALTERATION OF SHARE CAPITAL), to issue further shares in future. If the company has received the full nominal value of the shares issued, its paid-up capital equals its issued capital.

Examples of such acts are those carried out while sleepwalking or in a state of concussion or hypnotic trance, a spasm or reflex action, and acts carried out by a diabetic who suffers a hypoglycaemic episode. Automatism is not a defence, however, if it is self-induced (for example, by taking drink or drugs). When automatism is caused by a disease of the mind, the defence may be treated as one of insanity. Mere absent-mindedness, even when brought about by a combination of, for example, depression and diabetes, is not regarded as a defect of reason under the defence of insanity. It may, however, be grounds for concluding that the accused was not capable of having the necessary mens rea at the time of the offence.']]]],

[['', [['n. 1. (in marine insurance) A loss or damage arising from an event at sea.', '2. A reduction in the amount payable under an insurance policy in respect of a partial loss of property. All marine insurance policies are subject to average under the Marine Insurance Act 1906;other policies may be subject to average if they contain express provision to that effect (an average clause).', "In maritime law, the expression general (or gross) average is used in relation to certain acts, to the losses they cause, and to the rights of contribution to which they give rise. A general-average act consists of any sacrifice or expenditure made intentionally and reasonably to preserve property involved in a sea voyage. For example, the jettisoning of some of a ship's cargo to keep it afloat during a storm is a general-average act. The loss directly resulting from a general-average act is called general-average loss and is borne proportionately by all whose property has been saved. The owner of jettisoned cargo, for example, is entitled to a contribution from other cargo owners as well as the shipowners; such a contribution is called a general-average contribution. The principle of general average is common to the laws of all maritime nations, but the detailed rules are not uniform. To overcome conflict of law, a standard set of rules was agreed in the 19th century at international conferences of shipowners and others held at York and Antwerp. These, known as the York-Antwerp rules, do not have the force of law, but it is common practice to incorporate them (as subsequently amended) in contracts of affreightment, thereby displacing national laws. The basic principle is that an insured who has suffered a general-average loss may recover the whole of it from his underwriters without enforcing his rights to contribution; these become enforceable by the underwriters instead.", 'By contrast, particular average (also called simple or petty average) relates purely to marine insurance. It consists of any partial loss that is not a general-average loss (for example, the damage of cargo by seawater). It is therefore borne'], ['purely by the person suffering it and is frequently covered by a policy only in limited circumstances. A ship sold free from average is free from any claims whatsoever.']]]],

A person granted bail undertakes to pay a specified sum to the court if he fails to appear on the date set by the court (see also JUSTIFYING BAIL). This is known as bail in one's own recognizance. Often the court also requires guarantors (known as sureties) to undertake to produce the accused or to forfeit the sum fixed by the court if they fail to do so. In these circumstances the bailed person is, in theory, released into the custody of the sureties. Judges have wide discretionary powers as to whether or not bail should be granted, and for what sum. Normally an accused is granted bail unless it is likely that he will abscond, or interfere with witnesses, or unless he is accused of murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, rape, or attempted rape and has a previous conviction for such an offence.

Ownership of the goods remains in the bailor, who has the right to demand their return or direct their disposal at the end of the period (if any) fixed for the bailment or (if no period is fixed) at will. This right will, however, be qualified by any lien the bailee may have over the goods. Bailment exists independently of contract. But if the bailor receives payment for the bailment (a bailment for reward) there is often an express contract setting out the rights and obligations of the parties.

The official receiver must either call a creditors' meeting to appoint a trustee in bankruptcy to manage the bankrupt's affairs, or he becomes trustee himself.

Battered partners can apply for these orders if they are also applying for some other matrimonial relief (e.g. a divorce). The court must attach a power of arrest to a nonmolestation order or an occupation order if the abuser has used or threatened violence against his or her partner.

"Bill":
[['', [["n. A draft of a proposed Act of Parliament, which must (normally) be passed by both Houses before becoming an Act. Bills are either public or private, and the procedure governing their passing by Parliament depends basically on this distinction. In general, a public Bill is one relating to matters of general concern; it is introduced by the government or by a private member (private member's Bill). In the House of Commons the government sets aside certain Fridays for debate on private member's Bills,and a ballot at the beginning of each session of Parliament determines the members whose Bills are to have priority on those days. A private member's Bill that is not supported by the government stands little chance of successfully completing all stages and becoming an Act. The government sometimes prefers a private member to sponsor a particularly controversial Bill that they themselves support; for example, the Abortion Act 1967was introduced by a private member (David Steel) and was successful because it had the support of the government of the day. A public Bill, unless predominantly financial, can be introduced in either House (less controversial Bills are introduced in the Lords first). The Bill is presented by the minister or other member in charge, passed by being read three times, and then sent to the other House. Its first reading is a formality, but it is debated on second and third readings, between which it goes through a Committee stage and a Report stage during which amendments may be made. A Bill that has not become an Act by the end of the session lapses; if reintroduced in a subsequent session, it must go through all stages again.", 'A private Bill is one designed to benefit a particular person, local authority, or other body, by whom it is presented. It is introduced on a petition by the promoter, which is preceded by public advertisement and by notice to those directly affected.

Thereafter, it follows the procedure for public Bills.', 'A hybrid Bill is a government bill that is purely local or personal in character and affects only one of a number of interests in the same class. For example, a government Bill to nationalize one only of several private-sector airlines would be hybrid. A hybrid Bill proceeds as a public Bill until after second reading in the first House, after which it is treated similarly to a private Bill.']]]],

Any client dissatisfied with a bill can require his solicitor to obtain a remuneration certificate from the Law Society. The certificate will either say that the fee is fair and reasonable or it will substitute a lower fee. If the bill is endorsed with a notice saying that there is a right to ask for a remuneration certificate within one month, the client has one month from receipt of the bill to request the certificate. If the bill is not endorsed in this way, the client has a right to demand a remuneration certificate that lasts for one month from the time he was notified of this right. If the client requests a remuneration certificate, he must normally first pay half the bill and all the VAT on the bill and expenses and disbursements set out on the bill before the remuneration certificate is obtained, unless he has obtained permission from the Law Society to waive this requirement; this permission is given in exceptional circumstances. These rights are set out fully in the Solicitors (Non-Contentious Business) Remuneration Order 1994. In contentious (i.e. litigious) matters the bill is subject to assessment of costs.

"bill of exchange":
[['', [['An unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person (the drawer) to another (the drawee) and signed by the person giving it, requiring the drawee to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time a specified sum of money to or to the order of a specified person (the payee) or to the bearer. If the bill is payable at a future time the drawee signifies his acceptance, which makes him the party primarily liable upon the bill; the drawer and endorsers may also be liable upon a bill. The use of bills of exchange enables one person to transfer to another an enforceable right to a sum of money. A bill of exchange is not only transferable but also negotiable, since if a person without an enforceable right to the money transfers a bill to a holder in due course, the latter obtains a good title to it. Much of the law on bills of exchange is codified by the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 and the Cheques Act 1992.']]]],

"bill of lading":
[['', [["A document acknowledging the shipment of a consignor's goods for carriage by sea (compare SEA WAYBILL). lt is used primarily when the ship is carrying goods belonging to a number of consignors (a general ship). In this case, each consignor receives a bill issued (normally by the master of the ship) on behalf of either the shipowner or a charterer under a charterparty. The bill serves three functions: it is a receipt for the goods; it summarizes the terms of the contract of carriage; and it acts as a document of title to the goods. A bill of lading is also issued by a shipowner to a charterer who is using the ship for the carriage of his own goods. In this case, the terms of the contract of carriage are in the charterparty and the bill serves only as a receipt and a document of title. During transit, ownership of the goods may be transferred by delivering the bill to another if it is drawn to bearer or by endorsing it if it is drawn to order. lt is not, however, a negotiable instrument. The responsibilities, liabilities, rights, and immunities attaching to carriers under bills of lading are stated in the Hague Rules. These were drawn up by the International Law Association meeting at The Hague in 1921and adopted by an International Conference on Maritime Law held at Brussels in 1922.They were given effect in the UK by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1924 and so became known in the UKas the Hague Rules of 1924.They were amended at Brussels in effect being given to the amendments by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971. The Rules, which are set out in a schedule to the Act, apply to carriage under a bill of lading from any port in Great Britain or Northern Ireland to any other port and also to carriage between any of the states by which they have been adopted. Every bill issued in Great Britain or Northern Ireland to which the Rules apply must state that fact expressly (the clause giving effect to this requirement is customarily referred to as the paramount clause). The Hague Rules were completely rewritten in 1978in a new treaty known as the Hamburg Rules, which drastically alter the privileged position of a sea carrier as compared to other carriers, but they have not yet been generally adopted."]]]],
"bill of sale":
[['', [['A document by which a person transfers the ownership of goods to another. Commonly the goods are transferred conditionally, as security for a debt, and a conditional bill of sale is thus a mortgage of goods.

The injunction is most commonly granted to protect trade secrets (except patents, registered designs, and copyrights, which are protected under statute), but may also be granted, for example, to protect the secrecy of communications made between husband and wife during marriage or, possibly, between cohabitants during their period of cohabitation.

Information that has been disclosed anywhere in the world, unless it was disclosed under conditions (usually a contract) of confidence, cannot subsequently be prevented from disclosure by the courts.']]]],
"breach of contract":
[['', [["An actual failure by a party to a contract to perform his obligations under that contract or an indication of his intention not to do so. An indication that a contract will be breached in the future is called repudiation or an anticipatory breach,and may be either expressed in words or implied from conduct. Such an implication arises when the only reasonable inference from a person's acts is that he does not intend to fulfil his part of the bargain. For example, an anticipatory breach occurs if a person contracts to sell his car to A, but sells and delivers it to B before the delivery date agreed with A. The repudiation of a contract entitles the injured party to treat the contract as discharged and to sue immediately for damages for the loss sustained. The same procedure applies to an actual breach if it amounts to breach of a condition (sometimes referred to as fundamental breach)or breach of an innominate term when the consequences of breach are sufficiently serious. In either an anticipatory or actual breach, the injured party may, however, decide to affirm the contract instead. When an actual breach amounts to breach of a warranty, or breach of an innominate term and the consequences of breach are not sufficiently serious to allow for discharge, the injured party is entitled to sue for damages only. However, most commercial agreements provide a right to terminate the agreement even when the breach is minor, thus overriding the common law principle described here. The process of treating a contract as discharged by reason of repudiation or actual breach is sometimes referred to as rescission or repudiation, but this latter term is clearly confusing. Other remedies available under certain circumstances for breach of contract are an injunction and specific performance. See also PROCURING BREACH OF CONTRACT."]]]],

Earlier devices were based on a tube attached to a balloon, which the suspect had to inflate in one breath: a change in the colour of crystals inside the tube indicated that there was alcohol in the breath. A breathalyser should not be used within 20 minutes after consuming alcohol or on a suspect who has just been smoking.

"British citizenship":
[['', [['One of three forms of citizenship introduced by the British Nationality Act 1981, which replaced citizenship of the UK and Colonies.

On the date on which it came into force (1January 1983), the Act conferred British citizenship automatically on every existing citizen of the UK and Colonies who was entitled to the right of abode in the UK under the Immigration Act 1971 (see IMMIGRATION). As from that date, there have been four principal ways of acquiring the citizenship -by birth, by descent, by registration, and by naturalization. A person acquires it by birth only if he is born in the UK and his father or mother is either a British citizen or settled in the UK (i.e. resident there, and not restricted by the immigration laws as to length of stay). If born outside the UK, he acquires it by descent if one of his parents has British citizenship (but not, normally, if that citizenship was itself acquired by descent). The British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983makes special provisions to confer British citizenship on those people with connections with the Falkland Islands. The British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 gave additional rights to certain people from Hong Kong to acquire British citizenship "by descent" or "otherwise than with descent". Registration may be applied for by a minor, but adults are eligible only if they have particular links with the UK. In some cases (e.g. British Dependent Territories citizens, British Overseas citizens, British protected persons, and British subjects with certain residential qualifications), it is a right; in others, it is at the discretion of the Secretary of State. Any adult may apply for naturalization but there are residential and other requirements (e.g. proof of good character), and its grant is always discretionary.

As from that date, acquisition (and deprivation in the case of registered or naturalized citizens) have been governed by principles similar to those applying to British citizenship, except that acquisition by registration relates exclusively to minors. A British Dependent Territories citizen can become entitled to registration as a British citizen by virtue of UK residence.

A distinction is drawn between the persuasive (or legal) burden, which is carried by the party who as a matter of law will lose the case if he fails to prove the fact in issue; and the'], ['evidential burden (burden of adducing evidence or burden of going forward),'], ['which is the duty of showing that there is sufficient evidence to raise an issue fit for the consideration of the trier of fact as to the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue.', 'The normal rule is that a defendant is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty; it is therefore the duty of the prosecution to prove its case by establishing both the actus reus of the crime and the mens rea. It must first satisfy the evidential burden to show that its allegations have something to support them. If it cannot satisfy this burden, the defence may submit or the judge may direct that there is no case to answer, and the judge must direct the jury to acquit. The prosecution may sometimes rely on presumptions of fact to satisfy the evidential burden of proof (e.g.the fact that a woman was subjected to violence during sexual intercourse will normally raise a presumption to support a charge of rape and prove that she did not consent). If, however, the prosecution has established a basis for its case, it must then continue to satisfy the persuasive burden by proving its case beyond reasonable doubt (see also PROOF BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT). It is the duty of the judge to tell the jury clearly that the prosecution must prove its case and that it must prove it beyond reasonable doubt; if he does not give this clear direction, the defendant is entitled to be acquitted.', 'There are some exceptions to the normal rule that the burden of proof is upon the prosecution. The main exceptions are as follows.', '(1) When the defendant admits the elements of the crime (the actus reus and mens rea) but pleads a special defence, the evidential burden is upon him to create at least a reasonable doubt in his favour. This may occur, for example, in a prosecution for murder in which the defendant raises a defence of self-defence.', '(2) When the defendant pleads coercion, diminished responsibility, or insanity, both the evidential and persuasive burden rest upon him. In this case, however, it is sufficient if he proves his case on a balance of probabilities (Le. he must persuade the jury that it is more likely that he was insane than not).', '(3) In some cases statute expressly places a persuasive burden on the defendant; for example, a person who carries an offensive weapon in public is guilty of an offence unless he proves that he had lawful authority or a reasonable excuse for carrying it.']]]],

The clause is in effect in most cases superfluous -firstly, because diplomatic intervention belongs to the state only, and thus cannot be renounced by an individual; and secondly, because the exhaustion of local remedies is always taken to be a condition precedent to appealing for diplomatic intervention.

Assets that may be taxed in this way include stocks, shares, unit trusts, land, buildings, machinery, jewellery, and works of art.

"care order":
[['', [['A court order placing a child under the care of a local authority. Under the Children Act 1989 an application for a care order can only be made by a local authority, the NSPCC, or a person authorized by the Secretary of State. The court has the power to make a care order only when it is satisfied that a child is suffering or likely to suffer significant harm either caused by the care (or lack of care) given to it by its parents, or because the child is beyond parental control (the so-called threshold criteria). The phrase "significant harm", as defined in the Children Act, means ill treatment (including sexual abuse and forms of treatment that are not physical) or the impairment of health (either physical or mental) or development (whether physical, intellectual, emotional. social, or behavioural). Once the court IS satisfied that the threshold criteria have been satisfied, it must decide whether a care order would be in the best interests of the child. In so doing, it should scrutinize the care plan drawn up in respect of the child. The court may, instead of making a care order, make a supervision order or a section 8 order. Since the coming into force of the Human Rights Act 1998, the court must ensure that the granting of a care order will not be in breach of Article 8 (which guarantees a right to family life); the court must be satisfied that any intervention by the state between parents and children is proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting family life. A care order gives the local authority parental responsibility for the child who is the subject of the order. Although parents retain their parental responsibility, in practice all major decisions relating to the child are made by the local authority. While the child is in care, the local authority cannot change the child\'s religion or surname or consent to an adoption order or appoint a guardian. There is a presumption that parents will have reasonable contact with their children while in care; if the local authority wishes to prevent this, it must apply for a court order to limit such contact. A parent with parental responsibility, the child itself, or the local authority may apply to discharge a care order. No care order can be made with respect to a child who is over the age of 16. A local authority can no longer use wardship proceedings as an alternative means of obtaining a care order, nor may it take a child into care through administrative means.

Usually it is sufficient to prove that the accused had mens rea (intention or recklessness) in relation to the consequences; the burden of proof is on the prosecution. In tort it must be established that the defendant\'s tortious conduct caused or contributed to the damage to the claimant before the defendant can be found liable for that damage. Sometimes a distinction is made between the effective or immediate cause (causa causans) of the damage and any other cause in the sequence of events leading up to it (causa sine qua non). Simple causation problems are solved by the "but for" test (would the damage have occurred but for the defendant\'s tort?), but this test is inadequate for cases of concurrent or cumulative causes (e.g.if the acts of two independent tortfeasors would each have been sufficient to produce the damage).', 'Sometimes a new act or event (novus actus (or nova causa) interveniens) may break the legal chain of causation and relieve the defendant of responsibility. Thus if a house, which was empty because of a nuisance committed by the local authority, is occupied by squatters and damaged, the local authority is not responsible for the damage caused by the squatters. Similarly, if X stabs Y,who almost recovers from the wound but dies because of faulty medical treatment, X will not have "caused" the death. It has been held, however, that if a patient is dying from a wound and doctors switch off a life-support machine because he is clinically dead, the attacker, and not the doctors, "caused" the death. If death results because the victim has some unusual characteristic (e.g.a thin skull) or particular belief (e.g.he refuses a blood transfusion on religious grounds) there is no break in causation and the attacker is still guilty.']]]],

The caution is in the following terms: "You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence." The caution must be given before any questions are put. If a person is not under arrest when a caution is given, the officer must say so; if he is at a police station the officer must also tell him that he is free to leave and remind him that he may obtain legal advice.

Since the Child Support Act 1991, responsibility for the assessment, review, collection, and enforcement of maintenance for children is supervised by the Child Support Agency (CSA), an agency of the Department for Work and Pensions (formerly Social Security) established under the Act, rather than by the court.

The Agency has wide powers of enforcement: for example it can make an order for payment to be deducted directly from wages or salary (see also CLEAN BREAK). No distinction is made between married and unmarried parents, but when parentage is disputed the Agency has power to apply to the court for a declaration of parentage; if successful this will have effect only for the purposes of the Child Support Act.', "Certain changes, contained in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, have been (or will soon be) implemented; the most important of these is a change in the way in which the amount of maintenance payable by the nonresident parent is calculated. The original formula was extremely complex and took into account the income of the parent with care. The new formula is simply based on the following percentages of the net weekly income of the nonresident parent: 15% if there is one qualifying child; 20% if there are two qualifying children; and 25% if there are three or more. These amounts are reduced if the nonresident parent has one or more other children (for example, the children of a new partner) in his household and if he has staying contact with his child.

"classification of animals":
[['', [["At common law animals were formerly classified as wild by nature (ferae naturae) or tame by nature (mansuetae naturae), referring to the species in general rather than the individual animal. The owner of a wild animal was strictly liable for any damage it caused. The owner of a tame animal was liable for damage it caused if he knew that it had a vicious tendency abnormal in the species (the scienter rule). Special rules applied to damage done by cattle (see CATILE TRESPASS; DISTRESS DAMAGE FEASANT) and dogs. The common law classifications have been largely replaced by modern statutes. For purposes of civil liability in England, animals are classified as belonging to a dangerous or a nondangerous species (Animals Act 1971). A dangerous species is one not commonly domesticated in the British Isles, fully grown members of which are likely to cause severe damage. The keeper of an animal of a dangerous species is strictly liable for any damage it causes. Liability for damage done by other animals arises either under the Animals Act, if the animal was known by its keeper to have characteristics not normally found in that species, or only normally found in particular circumstances, which made it likely to cause that kind of damage; or under ordinary rules of tort liability. Thus carelessly allowing a dog to stray on the highway can make the keeper liable in negligence if it causes an accident, and excessive smell from a pig farm can be an actionable nuisance. The Animals Act also imposes strict liability for damage done by trespassing livestock, which includes cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, goats. and poultry. The keeper of a dog that kills or injures livestock is liable for the damage, except when the livestock was injured while straying on the keeper's land. If livestock is worried by a dog, the owner of the livestock (or the owner of the land on which the livestock lives) may kill or injure the dog to protect the livestock. In Scotland, there is strict liability for damage caused by animals belonging to a species likely to kill or severely injure persons or animals or cause material damage to property under the Animals (Scotland) Act 1987. The Act also excuses the killing or injuring of an animal that attacks or harries people or livestock. Dangerous wild animals may require a licence under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976(see DANGEROUS ANIMALS). Keeping dogs of a species bred for fighting is an offence under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. The use of guard dogs is controlled by the Guard Dogs Act 1975. Other statutes protect various species, control importation of animals, and deal with animal diseases."]]]],

A provision that would otherwise be unconscionable may be valid if the transaction containing it is a commercial arrangement rather than a mortgage. Thus, such provisions in mortgages of public houses or garages by their tenants or owners to breweries or oil companies will be upheld, provided that they do not infringe the contractual rules against restraint of trade.

A pre-entry agreement is one that prohibits an employer from engaging a relevant employee unless he is already a member of the union concerned. A post-entry agreement  requires employees to join the specified union within a certain time after the employment commences. Under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, all employees are free to join a trade union or not, as they wish. If an employer action, short of dismissal, against an employee to enforce membership of a union, the employee can complain to an employment tribunal, which can order the employer to pay him compensation. Dismissal for failure to belong to a trade union is automatically unfair (see INADMISSIBLE REASON). In this case there are special minimum rates of compensation payable. If, as a result of trade union pressure, an employer dismisses an employee for failing to belong to a union, the employer can join the union as a party to the dismissal proceedings and pass the liability to pay compensation on to the union.', 'A union that attempts to enforce a closed shop by industrial action loses the immunity from legal action that it would otherwise have if the action was in furtherance of a trade dispute. The effect of these provisions is that, while closed-shop agreements are not in themselves illegal, they are unenforceable by either employers or unions.']]]],

[['', [["Negotiations between trade unions (acting for their members) and employers about terms and conditions of employment. Under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992,a collective agreement (an agreement between trade union and employer resulting from collective bargaining) is not legally binding unless it is in writing and specifically states the parties' intention to be bound. Unenforceable collective agreements frequently include terms (relating to pay, discipline, etc.) that will become incorporated in individual employees' binding contracts of employment. In these respects the written particulars of employees' contracts, which the employer must give under the Employment Rights Act 1996,must refer the employee to the collective agreement, which must be reasonably accessible to him. Terms of a collective agreement that discriminate on grounds of sex may be challenged by individuals in a court or employment tribunal on the ground that they contravene the principle of equal treatment. When a collective agreement provides that individual employees' contracts will circumscribe their right to strike, the employees will only be bound if their contracts contain that provision and the collective agreement was negotiated by an independent trade union, is in writing, and is readily accessible to employees during working hours. The parties to a collective agreement containing procedures for determining complaints of unfair dismissal may apply to the Secretary of State for an order that those procedures be substituted for the statutory jurisdiction of employment tribunals. An order will only be made if the agreement was negotiated by an independent trade union, sufficiently identifies the employees affected, and gives them remedies as beneficial as the statutory scheme and a right to independent arbitration or adjudication.

The committal proceedings may consist of taking depositions from all the witnesses in the form of oral evidence.

The press may normally only report certain limited facts about committal proceedings, such as the name of the accused and the charges. However, if the accused asks that reporting restrictions be lifted, the magistrates may allow publication of full details of the proceedings. Concern as to the effectiveness of committal proceedings in preventing weak cases going to trial led to provisions in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994,which have now created a new transfer for trial procedure, based upon consideration of case documents.

"common law":
[['', [["1. The part of English law based on rules developed by the royal courts during the first three centuries after the Norman Conquest (1066) as a system applicable to the whole country, as opposed to local customs. The Normans did not attempt to make new law for the country or to impose French law on it; they were mainly concerned with establishing a strong central administration and safeguarding the royal revenues, and it was through machinery devised for these purposes that the common law developed. Royal representatives were sent on tours of the shires to check on the conduct of local affairs generally, and this involved their participating in the work of local courts. At the same time there split off from the body of advisers surrounding the king (the curia regis) the first permanent royal court the Court of Exchequer, sitting at Westminster to hear disputes concerning the revenues. Under Henry II (reigned 1154-89), to whom the development of the common law is principally due, the royal representatives were sent out on a regular basis (their tours being known as circuits) and their functions began to be exclusively judicial. Known as justiciaeerrantes (wandering justices), they took over the work of the local courts. In the same period there appeared at Westminster a second permanent royal court, the Court of Common Pleas. These two steps mark the real origins of the common law. The judges of the Court of Common Pleas so successfully superimposed a single system on the multiplicity of local customs that, as early as the end of the 12th century, reference is found in court records to the custom of the kingdom. In this process they were joined by the judges of the Court of Exchequer, which began to exercise jurisdiction in many cases involving disputes between subjects rather than the royal revenues, and by those of a third royal court that gradually emerged -the Court of King's Bench (see COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH). The common law was subsequently supplemented by equity, but it remained separately administered by the three courts of common law until they and the Court of Chancery (all of them sitting in Westminster Hall until rehoused in the Strand in 1872) were replaced by the High Court of Justice under the Judicature Acts 1873-75.", '2.

"Community legislation":
[['', [['Laws made by the Council of the European Union or the European Commission. Each body has legislative powers, but most legislation is made by the Council, based on proposals by the Commission, and usually after consultation with the European Parliament.

Community legislation is in the form of regulations, directives, and decisions. Regulations are of general application, binding in their entirety, and directly applicable in all member states without the need for individual member states to enact these domestically (see COMMUNITY LAw). Directives are addressed to one or more member states and require them to achieve (by amending national law if necessary) specified results. They are not directly applicable -they do not create enforceable Community rights in member states until the state has legislated in accordance with the directive: the domestic statute then creates the rights for the citizens of that country. A directive cannot therefore impose legal obligations on individuals or private bodies, but by its direct effect it confers rights on individuals against the state and state bodies, even before it has been implemented by changes to national law, by decisions of the European court. Decisions may be addressed either to states or to persons and are binding on them in their entirety. Both the Council and the Commission may also make recommendations, give opinions, and issue notices, but these are not legally binding.']]]],

The order may also require him to live in an approved probation hostel (for those offenders employed outside the hostel) or an approved probation home (for offenders not employed outside).

"compensation":
[['', [["n. Monetary payment to compensate for loss or damage. When someone has committed a criminal offence that caused personal injury, loss, or damage, and he has been convicted for this offence or it was taken into account when sentencing for another offence, the court may make a compensation order requiring the offender to pay compensation to the person suffering the loss (with interest, if need be). Magistrates' courts may make orders in respect of compensation. The court must take into account the offender's means and should avoid making excessively high orders or orders to be paid in long-term instalments. If the offender cannot afford to pay both a fine and compensation, priority should be given to payment of compensation. A compensation order may be made for funeral expenses or bereavement in respect of death resulting from an offence other than a death due to a motor-vehicle accident. Potential claimants and maximum compensation for bereavement are the same as those under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (see FATAL ACCIDENTS). An order may only be made in respect of injury, loss, or damage (other than loss suffered by a person's dependants in consequence of his death) due to a motor-vehicle accident if ", "(1) it is for damage to property occurring while it was outside the owner's possession in the case of offences under the Theft Act 1968,or ", "(2)the offender was uninsured to use the vehicle and compensation is not payable under the Motor Insurers' Bureau agreement. A court that does not award compensation must give reasons. Victims of criminal injury may apply for compensation under the Criminallnjuries Compensation Scheme. Under the Theft Act 1968,a restitution order in monetary terms may be made when the stolen goods are no longer in existence; this kind of order is equivalent to a compensation order. Compensation orders may be made in addition to, or instead of, other sentences. A court must order a parent or guardian of an offender under the age of 17 to pay a compensation order on behalf of the offender unless the parent or guardian cannot be found or it would be unreasonable to order him to pay it."], ['A person who has been wrongfully convicted of a criminal offence may apply to the Home Secretary for compensation, which is awarded upon the assessment of an independent assessor.'], ["An employment tribunal may order an employer to pay compensation to an employee who has been unfairly dismissed (see UNFAIR DISMISSAL). The compensation comprises a basic award of a sum equivalent to the redundancy payment to which a redundant employee would be entitled (with a minimum of ￡3300 when dismissal is for trade union activity), and a compensatory award representing the loss that the employee suffers because of the dismissal (the compensatory award is subject to an upper limit of ￡51,700). This will include compensation for the loss of his earnings and other benefits of the former employment, and for the loss of his statutory rights in respect of unfair dismissal and redundancy in the initial period of any new employment he obtains (see CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT). Additional compensation may be awarded if the employer does not comply with an order by the tribunal to re?employ the employee; the additional award will be between 26 and 52 weeks' pay. Limits on the amount of weekly pay that can be used in these calculations are set by regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and reviewed annually. The tribunal may reduce any compensation by an appropriate proportion when the employee's conduct has contributed to his dismissal. The employee is under the same duty to mitigate his loss as someone claiming damages in the courts. Thus if he unreasonably refuses an offer of a new job he will not be compensated for his continued unemployment thereafter. If the employee was dismissed for his failure to enter into a closed-shop agreement, following pressure by a trade union for his dismissal, the employer can pass on to the trade union the liability to pay compensation. Compensation may also be awarded by an employment tribunal when there is a finding of sexual or racial discrimination. In such cases the upper limit or financial cap on unfair dismissal damages has been removed, as the European Court of Justice has ruled that the cap is discriminatory and contrary to equal treatment laws. This award can also include an amount for hurt feelings."]]]],

Since the abolition in the 19th century of certain ancient grounds of incompetence, every person of sound mind and sufficient understanding has been competent, subject to certain exceptions. For example, a child may be sworn as a witness only if he understands the solemnity of the occasion and that the taking of an oath involves an obligation to tell the truth over and above the ordinary duty of doing so. However, under the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, a child below the age of 14 years may only give unsworn evidence. Since the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984and the subsequent 1999amendments, the spouse of an accused is generally a competent witness for the prosecution (subject to some exceptions) and compellable for the accused (subject to some exceptions).']]]],
"competition law":
[['', [['The branch of law concerned with the regulation of anticompetitive practices, restrictive trade practices, and abuses of a dominant position or market power. Such laws prohibit cartels and other commercial restrictive agreements. In the UK the Competition Act 1998and the Fair Trading Act 1973 contain the legislative provisions. Throughout the EU, Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of Rome and regulations made under those provisions contain the legal rules in this area, which constitute EU competition law. Under the de minimis principle, the European Commission has issued a notice that competition rules will be unlikely to apply to agreements affecting trade between member states when the parties to the agreement have a joint market share of 5% or less (10% for vertical agreements, such as distribution contracts). In the USAcompetition law is known as antitrust law.']]]],
"competitive tendering":
[['', [['The introduction of competition into the provision of public services with the aim of improving the cost-effectiveness and quality of these services. It affected a wide range of public bodies, from local authorities to the prison service: public services were supplied by the body (usually a private-sector company) that submitted the most competitive tender for the service in question. Examples of services most commonly provided by this means were refuse collection, the provision of school meals, and residential care for the elderly. These rules were principally contained in the Local Government Acts 1988 and 1992. The Local Government Act 1999abolished compulsory competitive tendering and replaced it with a duty to provide best value, whereby authorities must have regard to economy, efficiency, and effectiveness when exercising their functions.']]]],

"condition":
[['', [['n. 1. A major term of a contract. It is frequently described as a term that goes to the root of a contract or is of the essenceof a contract (see alsoTIME PROVISIONS IN CONTRACTS); it is contrasted with a warranty, which is a term of minor importance. Breach of a condition constitutes a fundamental breach of the contract and entitles the injured party to treat it as discharged, whereas breach of warranty is remediable only by an action for damages, subject to any contrary provision in a contract (see BREACH OF CONTRACT). A condition or a warranty may be either an express term or an implied term. In the case of an express term, the fact that the contract labels it a condition or a warranty is not regarded by the courts as conclusive of its status. See alsoINNOMINATE TERMS.', "2. A provision that does not form part of a contractual obligation but operates either to suspend the contract until a specified event has happened (a condition precedent) or to bring it to an end in certain specified circumstances (a condition subsequent).When X agrees to buy Y's car if it passes its MOT test, this is a condition precedent; a condition in a contract for the sale of goods that entitles the purchaser to return the goods if dissatisfied with them is a condition subsequent."]]]],

In return for accepting the risk of no fee, the lawyer is entitled to charge a higher fee (by claiming a higher uplift) if successful. If the claimant loses the case, he may have to pay the other party\'s costs. The litigation is therefore not entirely risk-free, although insurance, for which premiums are charged, can be taken out to accommodate this risk. The conditions on which a conditional fee agreement may be made (including the type of proceedings in which they are available and the maximum percentage increase in fees allowed) are prescribed by the Lord Chancellor under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and the Access to Justice Act 1999.

It does not include the acquisition of land as a term of a peace treaty (see CESSION). The acquisition of territory after a war in the absence of any peace treaty, because the defeated state has ceased to exist, is known as debellatio or subjugation. Conquest is not now regarded as a legitimate means of acquiring territory, and hence conferring valid title, as Article 2', '(4)of the UN Charter expressly prohibits aggressive war and Article 5', '(3) of General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX) of 1975effectively nullifies any legal title acquired in this way.']]]],

In criminal law, issues of consent arise mainly in connection with offences involving violence and dishonesty. For public-policy reasons, a victim's consent to conduct which foreseeably causes him bodily harm is no defence to a charge involving an assault, wounding, or homicide; in other cases the defendant should be acquitted if the magistrates or jury have a reasonable doubt not only as to whether the victim had consented but also as to whether he thought the victim had consented.

"consideration":
[['', [['n. An act, forbearance, or promise by one party to a contract that constitutes the price for which he buys the promise of the other. Consideration is essential to the validity of any contract other than one made by deed. Without consideration an agreement not made by deed is not binding: it is a nudum pactum (naked agreement), governed by the maxim ex nudo pacto non oritur actio (a right of action does not arise out of a naked agreement).', 'The doctrine of consideration is governed by four major principles. ', '(1) A valuable consideration is required, i.e. the act, forbearance, or promise must have some economic value. Good consideration (natural love and affection or a moral duty) is not enough to render a promise enforceable. ', "(2)Consideration need not be adequate but it must be sufficient. Not to be adequate in this context means that it need not constitute a realistic price for the promise it buys, as long as it has some economic value.IfXpromisestosellhis￡50,000housetoYfor ￡5000,Yisgivingvaluable consideration despite its inadequacy. ￡1 is often the consideration in commercial contracts. That it must be sufficient means sufficient in law. A person's performance of, or promise to perform, an existing duty usually cannot in law constitute consideration. ", "(3) Consideration must move from the promisee. Thus if X promises to give Y ￡1000in return for Y's promise to give employment to Z, Z cannot enforce Y's promise, for he has not supplied the consideration for it. ", '(4) Consideration may be executory or executed but must not be past. A promise in return for a promise (as in a contract of sale) is executory consideration; an act or forbearance in return for a promise (as in giving information to obtain a reward) is executed consideration. However, a completed act or forbearance is past consideration in relation to any subsequent promise. For example, if X gives information to Y gratuitously and Y then promises to reward him this is past consideration, which does not constitute consideration.']]]],

[['', [['The right of a mortgagee who has taken mortgages on two or more properties from the same mortagor to require the mortgagor to redeem all of the mortgages or none, provided that the contractual date of redemption (see POWER OF SALE) for all of them has passed.

"conspiracy":
[['', [['n. 1. An agreement between two or more people to behave in a manner that will automatically constitute an offence by at least one of them (e.g. two people agree that one of them shall steal while the other waits in a getaway car). The agreement is itself a statutory crime, usually punishable in the same way as the offence agreed on, even if it is not carried out. Mens rea,in the sense of knowledge of the facts that make the action criminal, is required by at least two of the conspirators, even if the crime agreed upon is one of strict liability. One may be guilty of conspiracy even if it is impossible to commit the offence agreed on (for example, when two or more people conspire to take money from a safe but, unknown to them, there is no money in it). A person is, however, not guilty of conspiracy if the only other party to the agreement is his (or her) spouse. Nor is there liability when the acts are to be carried out in furtherance of a trade dispute and involve only a summary and nonimprisonable offence. Incitement to conspire and attempt to conspire are no longer crimes. Some forms of criminal conspiracy still exist at common law. These are now limited to: ', '(1) conspiracy to defraud (e.g.to commit fraud, theft, obtain property by deception, or infringe a copyright) or to cause an official to act contrary to his public duty; ', '(2)conspiracy to corrupt public morals (see CORRUPTION OF PUBLIC MORALS); and ', '(3) conspiracy to outrage public decency (this might include an agreement to mount an indecent exhibition).', "2. A conspiracy to injure a third party is a tort if it causes damage to the person against whom the conspiracy is aimed. It is not necessary to prove that the conspirators used unlawful means. If unlawful means have not been used, conspiracy is not actionable if the predominant purpose of the conspirators was legitimate. Protection of one's own financial or trade interests is thus a legitimate purpose provided no unlawful means are used; but retaliation for an insult to one's dignity is not. The operation of the tort in trade disputes is limited by statute."]]]],

"constitutional conventions":
[['', [['Practices relating to the exercise of their functions by the Crown, the government, Parliament, and the judiciary that are not legally enforceable but are commonly followed as if they were. One of the most important is that the Crown must exercise its constitutional powers only in accordance with the advice of ministers who collectively command the support of a majority of the House of Commons. There is no single reason why conventions are observed. For example, it is a very old convention that Parliament must be summoned at least once a year. If that were not to happen, there would be no annual Finance Act and the government would be able to function only by raising illegal taxation. By contrast. if the Crown broke the convention that the royal assent must not be refused to a Bill duly passed by Parliament, illegal conduct would not necessarily follow (although the future of the monarchy could well be at risk). The basic reason for obeying conventions is to ensure that the machinery of government should function smoothly; conventions have not been codified into law and therefore can be modified informally to meet changing circumstances.']]]],

A purchaser of unregistered land has constructive notice of all matters that a prudent purchaser would discover on inspection of the property or proper investigation of the title. It has also been held that a purchaser has constructive notice of the rights of any person (such as a spouse) who may reside on the property but is not an owner of the legal estate and therefore does not appear on the title deeds. A purchaser of unregistered land is bound by all matters of which he has constructive, as well as actual, notice unless those matters are void against him for want of registration under the Land Charges Act 1972. Those dealing with registered companies have constructive notice of the contents of documents open to public inspection at the Companies Registry. See also ACTUAL NOTICE; IMPUTED NOTICE.']]]],
"constructive total 1055":
[['', [['A loss of a ship or cargo that is only partial but is treated for the purposes of a marine insurance policy as if it were an actual total loss. This may occur when an actual total loss either appears unavoidable (e.g.when a perishable cargo becomes stranded indefinitely) or can only be prevented by incurring expenditure greater than the value of the ship or cargo. In estimating the cost of repairs for this purpose, general average contributions by other insurers are left out of account, but the expense of salvage operations is a relevant factor. The insured must serve a notice of abandonment of the ship or cargo on the underwriters. This must be unconditional and served within a reasonable time of his learning of the loss; once accepted by the underwriters, it is irrevocable. The underwriters become liable to indemnify him as for a total loss and in return are entitled to all his rights in the ship or cargo.']]]],
"constructive trust":
[['', [['A trust imposed by equity to protect the interests of the beneficiaries when a trustee or some other person in a fiduciary relationship gains an advantage through his position. It differs from an implied trust in that no reference is normally made to the expressed or presumed intention of the parties. English law at present recognizes only the institutional constructive trust. This is a trust that automatically comes into being when certain circumstances arise; for example, when a person in a fiduciary position makes an unauthorized profit or when a stranger meddles in a trust. The concept is frequently used in commercial cases but not exclusively so. In a domestic setting, a constructive trust arises when a sole legal owner of property tries to exclude the rights of another person (usually a cohabitee) who has contributed to the purchase price of the property on the understanding that ownership of the property is to be shared, or when the sole legal owner tries to deny an express agreement to share ownership of the property.', 'Other Commonwealth jurisdictions recognize a remedial constructive trust: a trust imposed at the discretion of the court to remedy an injustice. This is not accepted by English courts, although recent case law has suggested that a development in this area is possible.']]]],

[['', [["The protection, especially by legal means, of consumers (those who contract otherwise than in the course of a business to obtain goods or services from those who supply them in the course of a business). It is the policy of current legislation to protect consumers against unfair contract terms. In particular they are protected against terms that attempt to exclude or restrict the seller's implied undertakings that he has a right to sell the goods, that the goods conform with either description or sample, and that they are of satisfactory quality and fit for their particular purpose (Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977). EU directive 93/13 renders unfair terms in consumer contracts void; it is implemented in the UK by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. The Office of Fair Trading runs a special unfair terms unit, which investigates cases in this field. There is also provision for the banning of unfair consumer trade practices (Fair Trading Act 1973). Consumers (including individual businessmen) are also protected when obtaining credit (Consumer Credit Act 1974) and there is provision for the imposition of standards relating to the safety of goods under the Consumer Protection Act 1987and the General Product Safety Regulations 1994.There are, in addition, many legislative measures that are product-specific, such as toy safety regulations.

[['', [['The "completion" of a marriage by an act of sexual intercourse. It is defined for these purposes as complete penetration of the vagina by the penis (although ejaculation is not necessary). A marriage may be consummated despite the use of a contraceptive sheath. If a spouse is incapable of consummation or refuses without good reason to consummate the marriage, these may be grounds for annulment of the marriage. If one of the partners refuses to arrange an additional marriage ceremony (e.g. in a church) without which he knows his spouse will not agree to have intercourse, this may be a good reason for the spouse\'s refusal to have intercourse. In this case it is the partner who refused to arrange the ceremony who is regarded as not having consummated the marriage, even though that partner is willing to have intercourse.']]]],

Such publications constitute strict-liability contempt, in which the intention to interfere with the course of justice is not required, but there are various special defences. It is also contempt under the Act to obtain or disclose any particulars of jury discussions and to bring into court or use a tape recorder without permission.

The coastal state is granted exclusive sovereign rights of exploitation over mineral resources and nonmoving species in its continental shelf, provided that this causes no unreasonable interference to navigation, fishing, or scientific research. The 1982 Conference on the Law of the Sea extends the continental shelf, in some cases, to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines around the coast from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. lt also makes special provisions for delimiting the continental shelf between states with adjacent or opposite coastlines, but does not lay down rules of law for such delimitation.

"continuous employment":
[['', [["The period for which a person's employment in the same business has subsisted. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996,employees have the right to claim certain statutory remedies only if they have been continuously employed for certain minimum periods. The required period of continuous employment necessary to bring an unfair dismissal action is currently one year. The right of employees to statutory redundancy payments and to guarantee payments arises after two years' and one month's continuous employment, respectively. The minimum period of notice to terminate an employee's contract also depends on his period of continuous employment in the business. When a business changes ownership as a going concern, the employee's period of continuous employment under both the old and the new employer counts in calculating the total (see also RELEVANT TRANSFER). When an employee is dismissed without notice, the minimum notice to which he was entitled is added to the actual period of employment in calculating whether or not he has served the minimum continuous period. Part-time employees (i.e. those whose normal working week is less than 16 hours) formerly had few statutory rights until they had completed five years' continuous employment in the business. However, the Employment Protection (Part?time Employees) Regulations 1995now provide that part-timers, no matter what hours they work, will benefit in the same way as those who are employed full time. Periods during which an employee was on strike do not break the continuity, but are excluded from his total period of continuous employment. Continuity is not broken when a woman is absent due to pregnancy or confinement, provided she takes up her right to return to work (see MATERNITY RIGHTS)."]]]],

Only a practising solicitor or licensed conveyancer may charge a fee for undertaking the most essential parts of such transactions. Under the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989land contacts must be made in writing. Apart from preparing the deeds or other documents by which the transaction is effected, certain investigative steps are usually required. For example, the sale and purchase of a residential house in England or Wales will generally involve the following.', "(1) Preparation of a contract by the vendor's solicitor defining the terms of the transaction, describing the property concerned, and disclosing land charges and other interests in it that will affect the purchaser. In the case of registered land, this will be accompanied by office copies of the registered title.", '(2)Written inquiries by the purchaser\'s solicitor seeking assurances from the vendor that matters which may not be apparent from inspection of the site will not impose any unforeseen liability on the purchaser. These questions generally cover such potential problems as disputes over boundaries, the construction or treatment of buildings, compliance with planning and rating authorities\' requirements, and liability for maintenance of shared facilities (such as boundary walls). If the Law Society\'s "Transaction" protocol is used, the vendor supplies a Seller\'s Property Information Form, which gives details of the property and replaces the standard preliminary inquiries.', "(3) Official search by the purchaser's solicitor in the local land charges register to ensure there are no undisclosed charges of a local or environmental nature that could bind the purchaser. The local authority is also asked to disclose other information, such as proposals for building new roads near the property. Other searches may be carried out at this stage, for example commons registration searches. If the land appears to be unregistered, there will be an official search of the index maps, to check that it has not, in fact, been registered.", '(4)If the purchaser is raising a mortgage loan towards the price, his solicitor or other agent will ensure that the funds will be available at the appropriate time and that any conditions imposed by the mortgagees can be satisfied.', "(5) The purchaser's solicitor may then negotiate alterations to the draft contract with the vendor's solicitor, in order to ensure its compliance with the purchaser's requirements and to cover points arising from the earlier inquiries and search. For example, if an unforeseen local land charge has been discovered, a term may be inserted requiring the vendor to clear it before the transaction is completed.", '(6) When there is a chain of sales and purchases dependent on one another, the solicitors for the parties involved liaise with one another through all steps of the transactions, particularly in arranging a date for completion, to ensure that the various completions coincide.', "(7) The parties become legally committed to buy and sell respectively upon exchange of contracts. It is then usual for the purchaser to pay a percentage of the price to the vendor's solicitor as stakeholder.", "(8) The vendor's solicitor next prepares and delivers an epitome or abstract of title to the purchaser's solicitor, who studies it to ensure that the vendor's title is proved in accordance with the contract. (It is increasingly common to deliver an epitome of title before exchange of contracts.) As final checks on the vendor's title, he conducts an official search in the Land Charges Department (for unregistered land) or HM Land Registry as appropriate, and raises requisitions on title requiring the vendor to clear any defects or adverse interests revealed by the abstract or search. An official certificate of search from the Land Registry will reveal any entries on the vendor's title effected since the date on which the office copies were issued, and will give the purchaser priority against any further entries provided he registers his new title within the time shown on the certificate.", "(9) The purchaser's solicitor prepares the deed (usually a conveyance, transfer, or assignment) by which the property is to be transferred to his client, and has its terms approved by the vendor's solicitor. He also ensures that the purchaser's mortgage deed (if any) is in order.", "(10) In preparation for completion, the purchaser's solicitor arranges with the necessary parties for the funds to be available on the completion date and ensures that the necessary deeds will be executed by the time completion takes place.", "(11) On completion, the purchaser's solicitor checks the vendor's original title deeds against the epitome (or abstract) of title, and takes possession of them together with the deed of transfer. In the case of registered land, he will take the land certificate, or accept an undertaking from the vendor's solicitor to forward it when it is made available following redemption of any mortgage. He hands over the price, and the transaction is then legally completed.", "(12) After completion, the transfer deed is produced to the Inland Revenue, and any stamp duty paid, by the purchaser's solicitor on his client's behalf.

"crime":
[['', [['n. An act (or sometimes a failure to act) that is deemed by statute or by the common law to be a public wrong and is therefore punishable by the state in criminal proceedings. Every crime consists of an actus reus accompanied by a specified mens rea (unless it is a crime of strict liability), and the prosecution must prove these elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt (see BURDEN OF PROOF). Some crimes are serious wrongs of a moral nature (e.g. murder or rape); others interfere with the smooth running of society (e.g.parking offences). Most prosecutions for crime are brought by the police (although they can also be initiated by private people); some require the consent of the Attorney General. Crimes are customarily divided into indictable offences (for trial by judge and jury) and summary offences (for trial by magistrates); some are hybrid (see OFFENCES TRIABLE EITHER WAY). Crimes are also divided into arrestable offences and nonarrestable offences. The punishments for a crime include death (for treason), life imprisonment (e.g. for murder), imprisonment for a specified period, suspended sentences of imprisonment, conditional discharges, probation, binding over, and fines; in most cases judges have discretion in deciding on the punishment (see SENTENCE).

It gradually became possible, however, to take proceedings against the Crown for damages for breach of contract or for the recovery of property. The form of the proceedings was a petition of right (not an ordinary action), and the procedure governing them was eventually regulated by the Petition of Right Act 1860.The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 replaced petitions of right by ordinary actions. It also made the Crown liable to action for the tort of any servant or agent committed in the course of his employment, for breach of its duties as an employer and as an occupier of property, and for breach of any statutory duty that is binding on the Crown. It does not affect the presumption of interpretation (see INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES) that statutes do not bind the Crown, nor does it affect Crown privilege.Formerly, members of the armed forces were unable to sue the Crown in tort for death or personal injury caused by a fellow member of the armed forces while on duty.

"custody":
[['', [['n. 1. Imprisonment or confinement. The current policy behind the use of custody was established in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and has been consolidated by the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. There is a twin-track approach, under which long custodial sentences will be levied on very serious crimes, particularly those of violence, but custody may be replaced with "community penalties" (punishment in the community, e.g. reparation in the community) for the less serious ones. The Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 establishes a framework for custodial sentencing that reflects this proportionality principle and includes a policy of reducing prison for non-serious offences. To this end, Section 79 of the Act introduces a "custody threshold" that has to be surmounted before any court can impose a custodial sentence, and section 80 imposes limits on the length of any custodial sentence given.', '2.

Legal memory began in 1189, but proof that a practice has been followed within living memory raises a presumption that it began before that date. Custom is one of the four sources of internationallaw. Its elaboration is a complex process involving the accumulation of state practice, i.e. ', '(1) the decisions of those who advise the state to act in a certain manner, ', '(2) the practices of international organizations, ', '(3) the decisions of international and national courts on disputed questions of international law, and ', '(4)the mediation of jurists who organize and evaluate the amorphous material of state activity.

If the gift fails after it has come into effect, cy-pres will operate automatically.

Damage for which there is no remedy in law is known as damnum sine injuria. Conversely, a legal wrong may not cause actual damage (injuria sine damno). If the wrong is actionable without proof of damage (such as trespass to land) and no damage has occurred, the claimant is entitled to nominal damages. Most torts, however, are only actionable if damage has been caused (see NEGLIGENCE). In Iibel and some forms of slander, damage to reputation is presumed.']]]],
"damages":
[['', [["pl. n. A sum of money awarded by a court as compensation for a tort or a breach of contract. Damages are usually a Iump-sum award (see also PROVISIONAL DAMAGES). The general principle is that the claimant is entitled to full compensation (restitutio in integrum) for his losses. Substantial damages are given when actual damage has been caused, but nominal damages may be given for breach of contract and for some torts (such as trespass) in which no damage has been caused, in order to vindicate the claimant's rights. Damages may be aggravated by the circumstances of the wrong. In exceptional cases in tort (but never in contract) exemplary damages may be given to punish the defendant's wrongdoing. Damages may be classified as unliquidated or liquidated. Liquidated damages are a sum fixed in advance by the parties to a contract as the amount to be paid in the event of a breach. They are recoverable provided that the sum fixed was a fair pre?estimate of the likely consequences of a breach, but not if they were imposed as a penalty. Unliquidated damages are damages the amount of which is fixed by the court, Damages may also be classified as general and special damages.The purpose of damages in tort is to put the claimant in the position he would have been in if the tort had not been committed. Recovery is limited by the rules of remoteness of damage. The claimant must take reasonable steps to mitigate his losses and so may be expected to undergo medical treatment for his injuries or to seek alternative employment if his injuries prevent him from doing his former job. Damages may also be reduced for the claimant's contributory negligence. The purpose of damages in contract is to put the claimant in the position he would have been in if the contract had been performed, but, as in the case of damages in tort, recovery is limited by rules relating to remoteness of damage. Again as in the case of torts, the claimant is also under a duty to take all reasonable steps to mitigate his losses and cannot claim compensation for any loss caused by his failure to do this. If, for example, a hotel reservation is cancelled, the hotelier must make all reasonable attempts to relet the room for the period in question or as much of it as possible.Damages obtained as a result of a cause of action provided by the Human Rights Act 1998will be provided on the basis of the principles of just satisfaction developed by the European Court of Human Rights."]]]],

"declaratory judgment":
[['', [["A judgment that merely states the court's opinion on a question of law or declares the rights of the parties, without normally including any provision for enforcement. A claim for declaration may, however, be combined with one for some substantive relief, such as damages."]]]],
"declaratory theory":
[['', [['The proposition that a state has capacity (and personality) in international law as soon as it exists in fact (that is, when it becomes competent in municipal law). This capacity is generated spontaneously from the assertion by the community that it is a judicial entity. When socially organized, the new state is internally legally organized, and hence competent to act in such a way as to engage itself in international responsibility. Thus, according to this theory, recognition does not create any state that did not already exist. See INTERNATIONAL LEGAL PERSONALITY. Compare CONSTITUTIVE THEORY.']]]],

"deductions":
[['', [["pl. n. (in employment law) Sums deducted from an employee's wages. The Employment Rights Act 1996 provides strict rules on what can be deducted from wages. Permitted deductions include those for income tax, national insurance, and pension contributions (for employees who have agreed to be part of an employer's pension scheme). Deductions are also allowed when there has been an overpayment of wages or expenses in the past, when there has been a strike and wages are withheld, or when there is a court order, such as an order from the Child Support Agency or a court attachment of earnings order. There are special rules for those in retail employment. These provide, for example, that deductions of up to 10%may be made from gross wages for cash shortages or stock deficiencies."]]]],
"deed":
[['', [['n. A written document that must make it clear on its face that it is intended to be a deed and validly executed as a deed. Before 31 July 1990, all deeds required a seal in order to be validly executed, but this requirement was abolished by the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989. A deed executed since that date by an individual requires only that it must be signed by its maker in the presence of a witness, or at the maker\'s direction and in the presence of two witnesses, and delivered. Deeds executed by companies require before delivery the signature of a director and secretary, or two directors, of the company; alternatively, if the company has a seal, the deed may be executed by affixing the company seal. If the deed is a contractual document, it is referred to as a specialty. A promise contained in a deed is called a covenant and is binding even if not supported by consideration. Covenants may be either express or implied. A deed normally takes effect on delivery; actual delivery constitutes handing it to the other party; constructive delivery involved (in strict theory) touching the seal with the finger, and saying words such as "I deliver this as my act and deed". If a deed is delivered but is not to become operative until a future date or until some condition has been fulfilled, it is called an escrow.The recitals of a deed are those parts that merely declare facts and do not effect any of the substance of the transaction. They are usually inserted to explain the reason for the transaction. The operative part of a deed is the part that actually effects the objects of the deed, as by transferring land. The testatum (or witnessing part) constitutes the opening words of the operative part, i.e. "Now this deed witnesseth as follows". The premisesare the words in the operative part that describe the parties and the transaction involved. The parcelsare the words in the premises that describe the property involved. The testimonium is the concluding part, beginning "In witness whereof", and containing the signatures of the parties and witnesses. The locus sigilli is the position indicated for placing the seal. When a deed refers to itself as "these presents", "presents" means present statements. The advantage of a deed over an ordinary contract is that the limitation period is 12 rather than 6 years (see LIMITATION OF ACTIONS) and no consideration is required for the deed to be enforceable. See also DEED POLl..']]]],
"deed of arrangement":
[['', [["A written agreement between a debtor and his creditors, when no bankruptcy order has been made, arranging the debtor's affairs either for the benefit of the creditors generally or, when the debtor is insolvent, for the benefit of at least three of the creditors. A deed of arrangement is regulated by statute and must be registered with the Department of Trade and Industry within seven days. It may take a number of different forms: it may be a composition, an assignment of the debtor's property to a trustee for the benefit of his creditors, or an agreement to wind up the debtor's business in such a way as to pay his debts. The debtor usually agrees to such an arrangement in order to avoid bankruptcy. A similar arrangement can be agreed after a bankruptcy order is made, but this is regulated in a different way (see VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT)."]]]],
"deed of covenant":

"defamation":
[['', [['n. The publication of a statement about a person that tends to lower his reputation in the opinion of right-thinking members of the community or to make them shun or avoid him. Defamation is usually in words, but pictures, gestures, and other acts can be defamatory. In English law, a distinction is made between defamation in permanent form (see LIBEL) and defamation not in permanent form (see SLANDER). This distinction is not made in Scotland. The remedies in tort for defamation are damages and injunction.'], ['In English law, the basis of the tort is injury to reputation, so it must be proved that the statement was communicated to someone other than the person defamed. In Scottish law, defamation includes injury to the feelings of the person defamed as well as injury to reputation, so an action can be brought when a statement is communicated only to the person defamed. If the statement is not obviously defamatory, the claimant must show that it would be understood in a defamatory sense (see INNUENDO). It is not necessary to prove that the defendant intended to refer to the claimant. The test is whether reasonable people would think the statement referred to him, but the defendant may escape liability for unintentional defamation by making an offer of amends (see APOLOGY). Other defences are justification, fair comment, absolute privilege, and qualified privilege.', 'All those involved in the publication of a defamatory statement, such as printers, publishers, and broadcasting companies, are liable and every repetition of a defamatory statement is a fresh publication, giving rise to a new cause of action. A mere distributor of a book, newspaper, etc., is not liable if he did not know and had no reason to know of its defamatory contents. The Defamation Act 1996 put this defence on a statutory footing and generally speeded up procedures for defamation litigation, but it did not change the rule that the jury and not the judge decides on the damages in defamation cases.']]]],
"default":
[['', [['n. Failure to do something required by law, usually failure to comply with mandatory rules of procedure. If a defendant in civil proceedings is in default (e.g. by failing to file a defence), the claimant may obtain judgment in default. If the claimant is in default, the defendant may apply to the court to dismiss the action.']]]],
"default notice":
[['', [['A notice that must be served on a contract breaker before taking action in consequence of his breach. Under the Consumer Credit Act 1974a default notice must be served on a debtor or hirer in breach of a regulated agreement before the creditor or owner is entitled to terminate the agreement; to demand earlier payment of any sum; to recover possession of any goods or land; to treat any right conferred on the debtor or hirer by the agreement as terminated, restricted, or deferred; or to enforce any security. The notice must specify the nature of the breach, what action (if any) is required to remedy it, and the date before which that action is to be taken. If the breach is not capable of remedy, the notice must specify the sum (if any) required in compensation and the date before which it is to be paid.']]]],
"default summons":

"defect":
[['', [['n. 1. A fault or failing in a thing. The defect may be obvious (a patent defect) or it may not be apparent at first (a latent defect).

If there is a patent defect he usually has no such remedy if he had an opportunity to inspect the goods before purchase. See also SATISFACTORY QUALITY.', '2. (defect in a product) A fault in a product as defined in the Consumer Protection Act 1987. A defect exists in products under the Act when the safety of the products is not what people generally are entitled to expect.

See also SAFETY AT WORK."]]]],
"defective premises":
[['', [["Liability for defects in the construction of buildings can arise both at common law, in contract and tort, and by statute. In addition to any liability they may incur for breach of contract, builders, architects, surveyors, etc., are liable in tort on ordinary principles for negligence and may also be in breach of statutory duties; for example, the duty imposed by the Defective Premises Act 1972, in respect of work connected with the provision of a dwelling, to see that the dwelling will be fit for habitation. A landlord who is responsible for repairs, or who has reserved the right to enter and carry out repairs, may be liable for damage caused by failure to repair not only to his tenants, but also to third parties who could be expected to be affected by the defects.

The statement should set out the nature of the defence in general terms (for example, mistaken identification, alibi), indicate the matters on which the accused takes issue with the prosecution, and set out in respect of each matter the reason why the accused takes issue.

The prohibition on degrading treatment or punishment as set out in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights is now part of UK law as a consequence of the Human Rights Act 1998. This right is an absolute right; such treatment can never be justified as being in the public interest, no matter how great that public interest might be.

"del credere agent":
[['', [['[Italian: of trust] See AGENT.']]]],
"delegated legislation (subordinate legislation)":
[['', [['Legislation made under powers conferred by an Act of Parliament (an enabling statute, often called the parent Act). The bulk of delegated legislation is governmental: it consists mainly of Orders in Council and instruments of various names (e.g. orders, regulations, rules, directions, and schemes) made by ministers (see also GOVERNMENT CIRCULARS). Its primary use is to supplement Acts of Parliament by prescribing the detailed and technical rules required for their operation; unlike an Act, it has the advantage that it can be made (and later amended if necessary) without taking up parliamentary time. Delegated legislation is also made by a variety of bodies outside central government, examples being byelaws, the Rules of the Supreme Court, and the codes of conduct of certain professional bodies (see also ORDERS OF COUNCIL).'], ['Most delegated legislation (byelaws are the main exception) is subject to some degree of parliamentary control, which may take any of three principal forms: ', '(1) a simple requirement that it be laid before Parliament after being made (thus ensuring that members become aware of its existence but affording them no special method or opportunity of questioning its substance); ', '(2)a provision that it be laid and, for a specified period, liable to annulment by a resolution of either House (negative resolution procedure); or ', '(3)a provision that it be laid and either shall not take effect until approved by resolutions of both Houses or shall cease to have effect unless approved within a specified period (affirmative resolution procedure). In the case of purely financial instruments, any provision for a negative or affirmative resolution refers to the House of Commons alone. (See also STATUTORY INSTRUMENT; SPECIAL PROCEDURE ORDERS.)'], ['All delegated legislation is subject to judicial control under the doctrine of ultra vires. Delegated legislation is interpreted in the light of the parent Act, so particular words are presumed to be used in the same sense as in that Act.

The rule applies particularly when the delegate possesses some special skill in the performance of the duties delegated, or when personal trust is involved. The rule does not apply if there is express or implied authority to delegate. Trustees, for example, have always been entitled to employ agents when this was necessary (for example, they can employ solicitors to do legal work). Since 1925,a trustee may delegate any business of the trust to an agent provided that he does so in good faith. Further, since 1971, any trustee may delegate, for a period not exceeding one year, any trusts, powers, or discretions he has; this delegation may be repeated.']]]],
"delivery":
[['', [['n. The transfer of possession of property from one person to another. Under the Sale of Goods Act 1979, a seller delivers goods to a buyer if he delivers them physically, if he makes symbolic delivery by delivering the document of title to them (e.g.a bill of lading) or other means of control over them (e.g. the keys of a warehouse in which they are stored), or if a third party who is holding them acknowledges that he now holds them for the buyer.

Departure is not permitted by the Civil Procedure Rules, but it does not prevent the amendment of documents used in litigation provided that the amended documents do not contain any departure. The principal effect of the rule is to prevent a claimant from setting up in his reply a new claim that is inconsistent with the cause of action alleged in the particulars of claim."]]]],

"dependent relative revocation":
[['', [['The doctrine that if a testator revokes his will in the mistaken belief that a particular result will ensue, or that a particular set of facts exists when it does not, then the revoked will may still hold good. For example, if a testator destroys his will, in the mistaken belief that thereby an earlier will would be revived, the destroyed will will be held not to have been revoked. Similarly, a testator may revoke his will, intending to make another; the revoked will holds good if the testator subsequently makes no new will or an invalid one.']]]],

In the UK this is authorized by the Immigration Act 1971 as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999in the case of any person who does not have the right of abode there (see IMMIGRATION). He may be ordered to leave the country in four circumstances: if he has overstayed or broken a condition attached to his permission to stay; if another person to whose family he belongs is deported; if (he being 17 or over) a court recommends deportation on his conviction of an offence punishable with imprisonment; or if the Secretary of State thinks his deportation to be for the public good. The Act enables appeals to be made against deportation orders. Normally, they are either direct to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal or to that tribunal after a preliminary appeal to an adjudicator. The Immigration Act 1988 restricts this right of appeal in the case of those who have failed to observe a condition or limitation on their leave to enter the UK. The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999gives additional powers to order those present in the UK without permission to leave, either when they have overstayed or obtained leave to remain by deception or when they were never granted leave to remain.

If the contract is completed without dispute the deposit becomes part payment. In land law a deposit is usually made by a purchaser when exchanging contracts (see EXCHANGE OF CONTRACTS) for the purchase of land. The contract stipulates whether the recipient (usually the vendor's solicitor or estate agent) holds the deposit as agent for the vendor, in which case the vendor can use the money pending completion of the transaction, or as stakeholder, in which case the funds must remain in the stakeholder's account until completion or (in the case of a dispute) a court has decided who should have it.

"deposition":
[['', [["n. A statement made on oath before a magistrate or court official by a witness and usually recorded in writing. In criminal cases depositions are taken during committal proceedings before the magistrates' court (see COMMITTAL FOR TRIAL). The usual procedure is that the prosecution witnesses give their evidence on oath and may be cross-examined by the accused or his legal advisers. The statement is then written down by the magistrates' clerk, read out to the witness in the presence of the accused, signed by the witness, and certified by the examining magistrate. The accused must be present throughout and be allowed to cross?examine. If these conditions are not fulfilled, both the committal proceedings and the subsequent trial will be null and void. There are special arrangements for depositions to be written down out of court if a witness is dangerously ill and cannot come to court, and also for depositions by children. Depositions made in committal proceedings are accepted as evidence at the trial if the witness is dead or insane, unfit to travel because of illness, or is being kept out of the way by the accused; they are also accepted to show a discrepancy between the deposition evidence and evidence given later on orally at the trial."], ['In civil cases the court may order an examiner of the court to take depositions from any witnesses who are (for example) ill or likely to be abroad at the time of the hearing.

Sometimes member states are allowed a longer than normal time to implement an EU directive.']]]],
"desertion":
[['', [['n. 1. The failure by a husband or wife to cohabit with his or her spouse. Desertion usually takes the form of physically leaving the home, but this is not essential: there may be desertion although both parties live under the same roof, if all elements of a shared life (e.g.sexual intercourse, eating meals together) have ceased. Desertion must be a unilateral act carried out against the wishes of the other spouse, with the intention of bringing married life to an end (animus deserendi). If it is continuous for more than two years, it may be evidence that the marriage has irretrievably broken down and entitle the deserted spouse to a decree of divorce. See also CONSTRUCTIVE DESERTION.', '2. An offence against service law committed by a member of the armed forces who leaves or fails to attend at his unit, ship, or place of duty. He must either intend at the time to remain permanently absent from duty without lawful authority or subsequently form that intention.

[['', [["n. Depriving a person of his liberty against his will following arrest. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 closely regulates police powers of detention and detained persons' rights. Detention of adults without charge is allowed only when it is necessary to secure or preserve evidence or to obtain it by questioning; it should only continue beyond 24 hours (to 36 hours) in respect of serious arrestable offences (e.g. rape, kidnapping, causing death by dangerous driving) when a superintendant or more senior officer reasonably believes it to be necessary. Magistrates' courts may then authorize a further extension without charge for up to 36 hours, which can be extended for another 36 hours, but the overall detention period cannot exceed 96 hours."], ["If the ground for detention ceases, or if further detention is not authorized, the detainee must either be released or be charged and either released on bail to appear before a court or taken before the next available court. An arrested person held in custody may have one person told of this as soon as practicable, though if a serious arrestable offence is involved and a senior police officer reasonably believes that this would interfere with the investigation, this can be delayed for up to 36 hours. The detainee has a broadly similar right of access to a solicitor. Terrorism suspects may be detained for up to seven days on a magistrate's authority."]]]],

It combines the former detention centre orders (against male offenders aged 14 to 20) and youth custody sentences (for males and females aged 15 to 20). The offence must be so serious, by itself or with another offence, that detention is the only justifiable outcome; alternatively it must be a violent or sexual offence and detention in such an institution is the only way of protecting the public from further injury or death. The court may consider mitigation and impose a noncustodial sentence. The minimum detention period is 21 days and the maximum period is 24 months. Other custodial sentences include custody for life and secure training orders.']]]],
"determinable interest":
[['', [["An interest that will automatically come to an end on the occurrence of some specified event (which, however, may never happen). For example, if A conveys land to B until he marries, B has a determinable interest that would pass back to A upon his marriage.

An interest that must end at some future point (e.g. a life interest) is not classified as a determinable interest, but one that could end during a person's life (for example a protective trust) is so classified. A determinable legal estate in land prior to 1925 was known as a determinable fee, but under the Law of Property Act 1925 it can now exist only as an equitable interest.

A ship must follow the course specified in a voyage or mixed insurance policy (see TIME POLICY); if no course is specified, the ship must follow the usual course for the voyage. Deviation discharges the underwriters from all liability for subsequent loss (even though it may not increase the risk) unless it is caused by circumstances beyond control or is justified on certain very limited grounds (e.g. to ensure the safety of the ship or to save human life, but not merely to save property). Unreasonable delay may also amount to deviation. Insurance cover does not revive when the ship rejoins the original course. Between the parties to a voyage charter, the possibility of deviation is normally the subject of an express deviation clause in the charterparty. For goods carried under a bill of lading, permitted deviation is dealt with by the Hague Rules.']]]],

However, the UK parliament reserved power to make laws for Scotland. The Government of Wales Act 1998 gave limited administrative powers to the Welsh Assembly with the UK parliament continuing to legislate for Wales. The Northern Ireland Act 1998established an elected Northern Ireland Assembly but made devolution of power to the Assembly conditional on the decommissioning of arms by paramilitary groups. The Northern Ireland Act 2000 enables power to revert to the UK parliament upon failure to decommission arms, suspending the Northern Ireland Assembly until the Secretary of State makes a restoration order.', '2.

Contracts of employment can be inspected by company members; long-term contracts may require approval by ordinary resolution. Usually, general management powers are vested in the directors acting collectively, although they may delegate some or all of these powers to the managing director. Directors act as agents of their company, to which they owe fiduciary duties (in the performance of which they must consider the interests of both company members and employees) and a duty of care. Transactions involving a conflict between their duty and their personal interests are regulated by the Companies Acts.

[['', [['Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, a person who has a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term effect on his abilities to carry out day-to-dayactivities. The Act makes it an offence to discriminate unjustifiably against anyone who is disabled. Discrimination occurs when a disabled employee (or interviewee) is treated less favourably by an employer (or potential employer) than someone without a disability, unless the employer can show that the difference in treatment is justified. Thus it is illegal for employers to refuse to employ someone qualified to do a job, simply because that person has, or has had, a physical or mental disability. In addition, employers have a duty to make alterations to premises to aid disabled employees. However, the law does not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees (i.e. after all staff at all branches are aggregated).', "On 5 March 2001 the government announced plans for significant changes to the Disability Discrimination Act.

For the purposes of disclosure, documents extend beyond paper to include anything upon which information is capable of being recorded and retrieved (e.g.tapes, computer disks). In small claims track proceedings, the initial disclosure is by a list of documents that the party intends to rely upon. In fast track and multi-track proceedings, the lists must include all documents, both those that support the party making the list and those adversely affecting that party, which they would prefer not to disclose. Directions for disclosure generally take place at the allocation stage or the case management conference and, unless the court directs or the parties agree otherwise, there will normally be a direction for standard disclosure. This involves a reasonable search by the parties to disclose documents on which that party intends to rely, documents that may be adverse to their own case or another party's case, documents that support another party's case, and documents that are required to be disclosed by any relevant Practice Direction. Some documents, although they must be disclosed in the list, may be privileged and thus exempted from the subsequent requirement to produce them for inspection (see PRIVILEGE). Once a party has served a list of documents, the other party, together with any co-defendants, must be allowed to inspect the (nonprivileged) documents referred to in the list within seven days of serving on the first party a written notice requesting inspection. If copies are needed, a further written notice must be served, with an undertaking to meet reasonable copying charges.

The duty to disclose this information only arises if the union requests the information. When disclosure would damage national security or harm the business (apart from its effect on collective bargaining), or the information is sub judiceor relevant only to particular individuals, disclosure need not be given. Guidelines on disclosure are published by ACAS (see also CODE OF PRACTICE). When an employer refuses to disclose essential information, the Central Arbitration Committee is empowered on the application of the trade union to make awards of wages and conditions that are ultimately enforceable in the courts.

See also CHARACTER."]]]],
"disqualification":
[['', [['n. Depriving someone of a right because he has committed a criminal offence or failed to comply with specified conditions. Disqualification is usually imposed in relation to activities requiring a licence, and in particular for traffic offences. In the case of many traffic offences, the court has discretion to disqualify drivers for a stated period. There are also a number of traffic offences for which disqualification for at least 12 months is compulsory (unless the offender can show special reasons relating to the circumstances of the offence, not to his personal circumstances). These offences are:', '(1) manslaughter;', '(2) causing death by dangerous driving (the minimum disqualification period here is two years);', '(3) causing death by careless driving;', '(4) dangerous driving;', '(5) driving or attempting to drive while unfit;', '(6)driving or attempting to drive with excess alcohol in the breath, blood, or urine (see DRUNKEN DRIVlNG);', '(7) failure (in certain cases) to provide a specimen of breath, blood, or urine; ', '(8)racing or speed trials on the highway. If a person is convicted for a second time within ten years of a driving offence involving drink or drugs, he must be disqualified for at least three years. The courts may also disqualify anyone who commits an indictable offence of any kind involving the use of a car. There is also a totting-up system of endorsements, which can result in disqualification. When someone is disqualified from driving, his licence will usually also be endorsed with details of the offence (but not with any penalty points for the purpose of totting up). The court may also make a driving-test order. A person who has been disqualified from driving may apply to have the disqualification removed after two years or half the period of disqualification (whichever is longer) or, when he has been disqualified for ten years or more, after five years.

In particular, consumers have rights to certain information about the contract to be entered into and, in many cases, the right to cancel the contract within a certain period, often seven working days from the day after receipt of the goods.

[['', [['n. The legal termination of a marriage and the obligations created by marriage, other than by a decree of nullity or presumption of death. The present law on divorce dates from 1969.Before this, the law required proof of a matrimonial offence (adultery, cruelty, or desertion of three years). The current law is contained in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973,which provides that there is only one ground for divorce, namely that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. Proceedings are initiated by either spouse filing a petition for divorce, stating the facts that have led to the marital breakdown and accompanied by a statement of arrangement for children, (Divorce proceedings may not be started within the first year of a marriage.) Irretrievable breakdown of a marriage may only be evidenced by one of the following five facts: ', '(1) that the respondent has committed adultery and the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent; ', '(2)that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent (see UNREASONABLE BEHAVIOUR); ', '(3) that the respondent has deserted the petitioner for at least two years (see DESERTION); ', '(4) that the parties have lived apart for at least two years and the respondent consents to a divorce; or ', '(5) that the parties have lived apart for at least five years. A respondent in a two-year separation case can apply for a postponement of the divorce until the court is satisfied that the petitioner has made fair and reasonable financial provision for the respondent. In a five-year separation case the court has the power to bar divorce if it believes that grave financial or other hardship would result from the dissolution and that it would be wrong to dissolve the marriage; however, this power is rarely exercised.', 'Divorce is a two-stage process. The first stage is the granting of a decree nisi; six weeks later the petitioner may apply for a decree absolute. The marriage is not terminated until the decree absolute has been granted. Uncontested divorce cases are heard under the special procedure; the majority of cases are now dealt with in this way. Divorce courts have wide powers under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 to make orders in respect of children and to adjust financial and property rights.

Ir is an offence to drive or attempt to drive a motor vehicle on a road or public place when one's ability to drive properly is impaired by alcohol or drugs. Drugs include medicines (such as insulin for diabetics), and the offence appears to be one of strict liability. It is also an offence to be in charge of a motor vehicle on a road or in a public place while unfit to drive because of drink or drugs, but the defendant will be acquitted if he can show that there was no likelihood of his driving the vehicle in this condition (for example, if he arranged for someone else to drive him if he became drunk). A police officer can arrest without a warrant anyone whom he reasonably suspects is committing or has been committing either of these offences; he may also (except in Scotland) enter any place where he believes the suspect to be, using force if necessary.", "(2) Driving over the prescribed limit. It is an offence to drive or attempt to drive a motor vehicle on a road or in a public place if the level of alcohol in one's breath, blood, or urine is above the specified prescribed limit (35micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres (ml) of breath; 80 milligrams (mg) of alcohol in 100 ml of blood; 107 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of urine -roughly equivalent to pints of beer, or 5 glasses of wine, or 5 single whiskies). It is also an offence to be in charge of a motor vehicle on a road or in a public place when the proportion of alcohol is more than the prescribed limit, subject to the same defence as in being in charge while unfit. Both these offences are offences of strict liability: it is therefore not a defence to show that one did not know that the drink was alcoholic or that it exceeded the prescribed limit. The normal way in which offences involving excess alcohol levels are proved is by taking a specimen of breath for laboratory analysis, but this is not necessary if the offence can be proved in some other way (for example, by evidence of how much a person drank before driving). There is no power to arrest a person on suspicion of committing or having committed an offence of this sort before administering a preliminary breath test.", 'Most charges involving drinking and driving are brought under the offence of driving over the prescribed limit rather than driving while unfit, but the powers to administer a breath test or to take a specimen of breath for analysis apply to both offences. The penalties for either of these offences are a fine and/or imprisonment, endorsement, and obligatory disqualification (in cases of driving or attempting to drive) or discretionary disqualification (in cases of being in charge). Under the totting-up system, the discretionary disqualification offences carry 10 penalty, points and the compulsory disqualification offences carry 3-11 penalty points (which are only imposed if there are special reasons preventing disqualification).

Duress is not a defence to a charge of murder as a principal (i.e. to someone who actually carries out the murder himself), although it is still a defence to someone charged with aiding and abetting murder. The threat need not be immediate; it is sufficient that it is effective; for example a threat in court to kill a witness may constitute duress and thus be a defence to a charge of perjury, even though it cannot be carried out in the courtroom.

There is no liability in tort for negligence unless the act or omission that causes damage is a breach of a duty of care owed to the claimant. There is a duty to take care in most situations in which one can reasonably foresee that one's actions may cause physical damage to the person or property of others. The duty is owed to those people likely to be affected by the conduct in question. Thus doctors have a duty of care to their patients and users of the highway have a duty of care to all other road users. But there is no general duty to prevent other persons causing damage or to rescue persons or property in danger, liability for careless words is more limited than liability for careless acts, and there is no general duty not to cause economic loss or psychiatric illness. In these and some other situations, the existence and scope of the duty of care depends on all the circumstances of the relationship between the parties. Most duties of care are the result of judicial decisions, but some are contained in statutes, such as the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 (see OCCUPIER'S LIABILITY)."]]]],

"easement":
[['', [["n. A right enjoyed by the owner of land (the dominant tenement) to a benefit from other land (the servient tenement). An easement benefits and binds the land itself and therefore continues despite any change of ownership of either dominant or servient tenement, although it will be extinguished if the two tenements come into common ownership (compare QUASI-EASEMENT). It may be acquired by statute (for example, local Acts of Parliament), expressly granted (e.g. by deed giving a right of way), arise by implication (e.g. an easement of support from an adjoining building), or be acquired by prescription. (See also PROFIT A PRENDRE.) An easement can exist as either a legal or an equitable interest in land. Only easements created by statute, deed, or prescription and held on terms equivalent to a fee simple absolute in possession or term of years absolute qualify as legal easements and are binding on all who acquire the unregistered servient tenement or any interest in it Legal easements over registered land should be registered but in practice will usually be binding without registration. All others are equitable easements and must generally be registered to be enforceable against a third party who acquires the servient tenement for value in money or money's worth. Under section 62 of the Law of Property Act 1925,when land is conveyed, all easements appertaining to it automatically pass with it without the necessity for express words in the conveyance. See also REGISTRATION OF ENCUMBRANCES."]]]],

[['', [['An easement arising by implication in favour either of a grantee of land over land retained by the grantor or, more rarely, of a grantor of land over land that he has granted, when access to any land granted or retained would otherwise be excluded by the operation of the grant. For example, if A, who owns a plot of land adjoining a highway, sells off the part of the plot immediately adjacent to the highway but retains the rest, an easement of necessity over the sold plot is implied if A has no other access to the plot he has retained. If there is any other right of access to the retained plot, there can be no easement of necessity, no matter how inconvenient that access proves to be. Any claimant must be able to prove that the land retained would be inoperative without the easement. The easement may be extinguished if alternative access becomes possible. The implication of necessity can be excluded by the terms of the grant; for example, when the grantor particularly wishes the land retained by him to remain inaccessible.']]]],

The tribunals hear, inter alia, complaints concerning unfair dismissal, redundancy, equal pay, maternity rights, and complaints of unlawful deductions from wages under the Employment Rights Act 1996(Part II).Tribunals sit in local centres in public and usually consist of a legally qualified chairman and two independent laymen, although chairmen are permitted to sit alone, without lay members, for certain types of case (e.g. deductions from wages claims), cases where the parties agree in writing, and uncontested cases. An ET differs from a civil court in that it cannot enforce its own awards (this must be done by separate application to a court) and it can conduct its proceedings informally. Strict rules of evidence need not apply and the parties can present their own case or be represented by anyone they wish at their own expense. The tribunal has wide powers to declare a dismissal unfair and to award compensation, which is the usual remedy, but they also have power to order the reinstatement or re-engagement of a dismissed employee. In cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct employment tribunals are empowered to make a restricted reporting order, which prevents identification of anyone pursuing or affected by the allegations until the tribunal’s decision is promulgated. There is also a power to remove identifying information in such cases from the decisions and other public documents. Before conducting a full hearing of the case, the tribunal may consider (on either party's application or on its own initiative) what the parties have said in the written complaint to the tribunal (the originating application) and the answer to it (the notice of appearance) in a prehearing assessment. If this assessment suggests that either party is unlikely to succeed, the tribunal may warn that party that he may be ordered to pay the other's costs if he insists on pursuing his case to a full hearing. When a full hearing takes place, the tribunal will not award costs to the successful party unless the other has been warned of this likelihood at a prehearing assessment or has acted vexatiously, frivolously, or unreasonably in bringing or defending the proceedings.

Certain encumbrances affecting unregistered land will only be enforceable against third parties if registered at the Land Charges Registry. See also REGISTRATION OF ENCUMBRANCES.']]]],
"endorsement":
[['', [['n. 1. The procedure in which the particulars of a driving offence are noted on a person\'s driving licence. When the court orders endorsement for an offence carrying obligatory or discretionary disqualification but the driver is not disqualified, the endorsement also contains particulars of the number of penalty points imposed for the purposes of totting up. When the court orders disqualification, only the particulars of the offence are noted. The courts can order endorsement upon a conviction for most traffic offences (the main exceptions being parking offences) and in many cases they must order an endorsement, unless there are special reasons (e.g. a sudden emergency) why they should not. A person whose licence is to be endorsed must produce it for the court; if he does not do so, his licence may be suspended. A driver whose licence has been endorsed may apply to have a new "clean" licence after a certain number of years has elapsed (usually 4 years, but 11 in the case of offences involving drunken driving). Under the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Act 1995, with effect from 1 June 1997, a driver who is convicted of an endorsable offence and who has accumulated 6 or more penalty points within two years of passing a driving test has his licence revoked and must retake a driving test.', '2. The signature of the holder on a bill of exchange, which is an essential step in negotiating or transfering a bill payable to order. The endorsement must be completed by delivering the bill to the transferee. An endorsement in blank is the bare signature of the holder and makes the bill payable to bearer. A special endorsement specifies the person to whom (or to whose order) the bill is payable (e.g. "Pay X or order"). An endorser, by endorsing a bill, takes on certain obligations to the holder or a subsequent endorser.', '3. The noting on a document of details of a later transaction affecting the subject matter of that document. For example, a beneficiary in whose favour a personal representative executes an assent of property may require details of the assent to be written (endorsed) on the document containing the probate or letters of administration. Equally, a purchaser of a plot forming part of a larger plot of land may require a note or memorandum of the conveyance to him to be endorsed on the title deeds relating to the whole plot.']]]],

"enforcement action":
[['', [['Any action, authorized by the United Nations Security Council, to enforce collective security under Chapter VII (i.e. Articles 39-51) of the UN Charter. As such it stands as one of the very few legal justifications for use of force in international law. Strictly, any enforcement action can only be justified under Article 42 of the Charter, which requires agreement by member states to place their armed forces at the disposal of the UN (see MILITARY STAFF COMMITTEE). However, although the theory of enforcement action would seem to be that of concerted action by members under Article 42, such a limitation is not expressly stated in the Charter. Article 39 was worded so widely as to allow the Security Council, using the implied powers allowed for by that Article, to bypass this problem and authorize that member states voluntarily furnish armed forces to be under the unified command of one member state. Upon the basis of such implied power, an enforcement action was justified under Security Council recommendations under Article 39 in order to defend Korea (1950).']]]],
"enforcement notice":
[['', [['A notice by a local planning authority (see TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING) that requires certain steps to be taken within a specified time to remedy an alleged breach of planning control. An example of such a breach would occur if development was carried out without planning permission or contrary to conditions attached to planning permission. A local planning authority that has notice of a breach of planning control has, however, a discretion as to whether to enforce against that breach. Appeal against the notice may be made to the Secretary of State on various grounds, including the ground that the development is one for which planning permission ought to be granted.

In the county court (and in the High Court in certain matrimonial proceedings only) attachment of the debtor's earnings is also available. Judgments for possession of land may be enforced by writ of possession (in the county court, a warrant of possession).

A tenant has a statutory right of enfranchisement when he has a long lease (exceeding 21 years) and the house has been his main residence for at least three years. The valuation of the freehold, or rent of an extended lease, is based on the value of the land without the buildings on it. The Leasehold Reform Act 1993 abolished the rateable value limits for houses and extended to flat leaseholders the right to acquire collectively the freeholds of their flats. From 1 April 1997 the Housing Act 1996 abolished in most cases an earlier requirement that enfranchisement only applied to leases at a low rent with a duration of over 35 years. This area of the law is currently under review, with a view to relaxing rules for qualification and residency.']]]],

[['', [['An agreement, verbal or in writing, to marry at a future date. Such agreements are no longer treated as enforceable legal contracts, and no action can be brought for breach of such an agreement or to recover expenses incurred as a result of the agreement.

"entrapment":
[['', [['n. Deliberately trapping a person into committing a crime in order to secure his conviction, as by offering to buy drugs. English courts do not recognize a defence of entrapment as such, since the defendant is still considered to have a free choice in his acts. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984,entrapment may be a reason for making certain evidence inadmissible on the ground that the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it. The question of the admissibility of evidence obtained through entrapment is in some doubt as a consequence of the cases now being decided under the "Human Rights Act 1998. Entrapment may also be used as a reason for mitigating a sentence. See also AGENT PROVOCATEUR.']]]],
"entry into possession":
[['', [['The act of going upon land to assert some right over it. For example, a lease usually gives the landlord the right to enter and take possession if the tenant fails to pay the rent or commits a breach of covenant.

It consists of 8-15 Commissioners. See SEX DISCRIMINATION.']]]],
"equal pay":
[['', [['The requirement of the Equal Pay Act 1970 that men and women in the same employment must be paid at the same rate for like work or work rated as equivalent or of equal value. They are in the same employment if they work at the same establishment (or if one works at an establishment that includes the other\'s) and they work for the same or an associated employer. The establishments must also be those at which the terms and conditions of employment are observed generally or for employees of the relevant description. "Like work" is work that is broadly similar, where any differences between the man\'s work and the woman\'s are not of practical importance. Work is rated as equivalent when the employer has undertaken a study to evaluate his employees\' jobs in terms of the skill, effort, and responsibility demanded of them and the woman\'s job is given the same grade as the man\'s. If the employer has no job-evaluation scheme, an independent expert is appointed by an employment tribunal to evaluate the two jobs to see if they are of equal value. Thus when the employer\'s job-grading system or the expert\'s report recognizes that the woman\'s job is as demanding as the man\'s, they are entitled to equal pay even though the nature of the work they do is very different. An employer\'s job-evaluation system can be challenged on the basis that it is discriminatory. See also EQUALITY CLAUSE.', 'The Code of Practice on Equal Pay, which was drafted by the Equal Opportunities Commission and applies to all employers, came into effect on 26 March 1997. The Code requires employers to review current pay structures and policy; introduce an equal-pay policy and ensure that pay structures and grades are transparent; change any rules of practice that are likely to result in discrimination in pay; establish a continuous monitoring procedure and on-going assessment so that bad practices do not develop; and assess whether there are any discrepancies in pay levels between male and female staff.

"equality clause":
[['', [['A clause in a contract of employment stipulating that if a woman is employed on similar work to that of a man in the same employment, or on work rated as equivalent or of like value to his, the terms of her contract must place her in no less favourable a position than the man. A contract not containing such a clause (either directly or as a result of some collective agreement) is deemed to include one by virtue of the Equal Pay Act 1970 as amended by the Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986 and by the Equal Pay (Amendment) Regulations 1983.

Equality of arms requires that there be a fair balance between the opportunities afforded the parties involved in litigation (for example, each party should be able to call witnesses and cross-examine the witnesses called by the other party). In some circumstances this may require the provision of financial support to allow a person of limited means to pay for legal representation.']]]],

"equitable interests":
[['', [['Interests in property originally recognized by the Court of Chancery, as distinct from legal interests recognized in the common-law courts. They arose in cases when it was against the principles of equity for a person to enforce a legal right. Originally equitable rights (e.g. a trust, or the equity of redemption under a mortgage) were enforceable against the person with a legal right over property in question. Later, however, those who were given the property by the holder of the legal interests took it subject to equitable interests; later still, anyone who bought property knowing of the equitable interests was bound by them. In the developed law, everyone took property subject to equitable interests except those who bought it and neither knew nor ought to have known of the equitable interests (the doctrine of notice). Since 1925, equitable interests may be protected by the doctrine of overreaching, under the system of land charges, or by notice.']]]],
"equitable lease":
[['', [['An agreement for the grant of an interest in land on terms that correspond to a legal lease but do not comply with the necessary formal requirements of a legal lease. For example, if L purports to grant T a lease for seven years but the transaction is effected by simple written contract to grant a lease rather than by deed, the court may enforce the contract to grant the lease between the parties. This follows the principle that "equity looks upon that as done which ought to be done" (see MAXIMS OF EQUITY). Further, T\'s rights under the contract could be registered as an estate contract and thus bind any third party acquiring L’s interest in the land.']]]],

"equity":
[['', [['n. 1. That part of English law originally administered by the Lord . Chancellor and later by the Court of Chancery, as distinct from that administered by the courts of common law. The common law did not recognize certain concepts (e.g. uses and trusts) and its remedies were limited in scope and flexibility, Since it relied primarily on the remedy of damages. In the Middle Ages litigants were entitled to petition the king, who relied on the advice of his Chancellor, commonly an ecclesiastic ("the keeper of the king\'s conscience"), to do justice In each case. By the 15th century, petitions were referred directly to the Chancellor, who dealt with cases on a flexible basis: he was more concerned with the fair result than with rigid principles of law (hence the jurist John Selden\'s jibe that "equity varied with the length of the Chancellor\'s foot"). Moreover, if a defendant refused to comply with the Chancellor\'s order, he would be imprisoned for contempt of the order until he chose to comply (see IN PERSONAM). In the 17th century conflict arose between the common-law judges and the Chancellor as to who should prevail; James I resolved the dispute in favour of the Chancellor. General principles began to emerge, and by the early 19th century the Court of Chancery was more organized and its jurisdiction, once flexible, had ossified into a body of precedent with fixed principles. The Court of Chancery had varying types of jurisdiction (see AUXILIARY JURISDICTION; CONCURRENT JURISDICTION; EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION) and many of its general principles were stated in the form of maxims of equity; equity had (and still has) certain doctrines (see ELECTION; CONVERSION; RECONVERSION; PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACT: SATISFACTION). Under the Judicature Acts 1873-75, with the establishment of the High Court of Justice to administer both common law and equity, the Court of Chancery was abolished (though much of its work is still carried out by the "Chancery Division). The Judicature Acts also provided that in cases in which there was a conflict between the rules of law and equity, the rules of equity should prevail. The main areas of equitable jurisdiction now include trusts, equitable interests over property, relief against forfeiture and penalties, and equitable remedies. Equity is thus a regulated scheme of legal principles, but new developments are still possible ("equity is not past the age of child-bearing"): recent examples of its creativity include the freezing injunction and the search order.', '2.

Any clogs on the equity of redemption are void, but the mortgagor's rights may be terminated under certain circumstances (see MORTGAGE).", "Before 1926 a mortgage was commonly effected by the transfer of the mortgagor's interest in the property to the mortgagee, but the mortgagor's rights were recognized by equity.

"erga omnes obligations":
[['', [["[Latin: towards all] (in international law) Obligations in whose fulfilment all states have a legal interest because their subject matter is of importance to the international community as a whole. It follows from this that the breach of such an obligation is of concern not only to the victimized state but also to all the other members of the international community. Thus, in the event of a breach of these obligations, every state must be considered justified in invoking (probably through judicial channels) the responsibility of the guilty state committing the internationally wrongful act.

Estoppel by deed prevents a person who has executed a deed from saying that the facts stated III the deed are not true. Estoppel by record (or per rem judicatam) prevents a person from reopening questions that are res judicata (i.e. that have been determined against him in a previous legal proceeding). See also ISSUE ESTOPPEL.', 'There are two forms of equitable estoppel -promissory and proprietary. The doctrine of promissory estoppel applies when one party to a contract promises the other (by words or conduct) that he will not enforce his rights under the contract in whole or in part. Provided that the other party has acted in reliance on that promise, it will though unsupported by consideration, bind the person making it: he will not be allowed subsequently to sue on the contract. When applicable, the doctrine thus modifies the common-law rules relating to accord and satisfaction. Under the doctrine of proprietary estoppel, the courts can grant a discretionary remedy in Circumstances where an owner of land has implicitly or explicitly led another to act detrimentally in the belief that rights in or over land would be acquired. The remedy may take the form of the grant of a fee simple in the property at one extreme or the grant of a short-term occupational licence at the other.']]]],

"Estrada doctrine":
[['', [['The doctrine that recognition of a government should be based on its de facto existence, rather than on its legitimacy. It is named after Don Genero Estrada, the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs who in 1930 ordered that Mexican diplomats should issue no declarations that amounted to a grant of recognition: he felt that this was an insulting practice and offended against the sovereignty of other nations. In 1980 the UK, USA, and many other states adopted the Estrada doctrine. Compare TOBAR DOCTRINE.']]]],

"ET":
[['', [['See EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL.']]], ['ET', [["Any of the bodies established under the employment protection legislation, consolidated by the Employment (formerly Industrial) Tribunals Act 1996,to hear and rule on certain disputes between employers and employees or trade unions relating to statutory terms and conditions of employment. (Originally called industrial tribunals, they (and the 1996Act) were renamed under the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998.) The tribunals hear, inter alia, complaints concerning unfair dismissal, redundancy, equal pay, maternity rights, and complaints of unlawful deductions from wages under the Employment Rights Act 1996(Part II).Tribunals sit in local centres in public and usually consist of a legally qualified chairman and two independent laymen, although chairmen are permitted to sit alone, without lay members, for certain types of case (e.g. deductions from wages claims), cases where the parties agree in writing, and uncontested cases. An ET differs from a civil court in that it cannot enforce its own awards (this must be done by separate application to a court) and it can conduct its proceedings informally. Strict rules of evidence need not apply and the parties can present their own case or be represented by anyone they wish at their own expense. The tribunal has wide powers to declare a dismissal unfair and to award compensation, which is the usual remedy, but they also have power to order the reinstatement or re-engagement of a dismissed employee. In cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct employment tribunals are empowered to make a restricted reporting order, which prevents identification of anyone pursuing or affected by the allegations until the tribunal’s decision is promulgated. There is also a power to remove identifying information in such cases from the decisions and other public documents. Before conducting a full hearing of the case, the tribunal may consider (on either party's application or on its own initiative) what the parties have said in the written complaint to the tribunal (the originating application) and the answer to it (the notice of appearance) in a prehearing assessment. If this assessment suggests that either party is unlikely to succeed, the tribunal may warn that party that he may be ordered to pay the other's costs if he insists on pursuing his case to a full hearing. When a full hearing takes place, the tribunal will not award costs to the successful party unless the other has been warned of this likelihood at a prehearing assessment or has acted vexatiously, frivolously, or unreasonably in bringing or defending the proceedings. An appeal on a point of law arising from any decision on an ET may be heard by the Employment Appeal Tribunal."]]]],

Its more detailed aims included eliminating customs duties internally and adopting a common customs tariff externally, the following by member states of common policies on agriculture and transport, promoting the free movement of labour and capital between member states, and outlawing within the Community all practices leading to the distortion of competition (see ARTICLE 81). Two of its institutions, the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice, were shared with the European Coal and Steel Community (established in 1951) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom; established in 1957); the separate executive and legislative bodies of these three European Communities were merged in 1967 (see EUROPEAN COMMISSION; COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION).', 'The Single European Act 1986,given effect in the UK by the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1986,contains provisions designed to make "concrete progress" towards European unity, including measures to establish a Single Market for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and persons within the Community: the Single Market came into operation on 1 January 1993. In February 1992 the member states signed the Treaty on European Union (see MAASTRICHT TREATY).

The Convention established a Commission on Human Rights and a Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Commission may hear complaints (known as petitions) by one state against another. It may also hear complaints by an individual, group, or nongovernmental organization claiming to be a victim of a breach of the Convention, provided that the state against which the complaint has been made declares that it recognizes the authority of the Commission to receive such petitions. The Commission cannot deal with any complaint, however, unless the applicant has first tried all possible remedies in the national courts (in England he must usually first appeal to the House of Lords). All complaints must be made not later than six months from the date on which the final decision against the applicant was made in the national courts. The Commission will only investigate a complaint if it is judged to fulfil various conditions that make it admissible. If the Commission thinks there has. been a breach of the Convention, it places itself at the disposal of the parties in an attempt to achieve a friendly settlement. If this fails, the Commission sends a report on the case to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. The case may then be brought before the Court within three months by either the Commission or one of the states concerned (an individual victim cannot take the matter to the Court himself). No case can be brought before the Court, however, unless the state against which the complaint is made has accepted the Court's jurisdiction. The Court then has power to make a final ruling, which is binding on the parties, and in some cases to award compensation. If the matter is not taken to the Court, a decision is made instead by the Committee of Ministers.", 'The Convention has established a considerable body of jurisprudence.

"exemption clause":
[['', [['A term in a contract purporting to exclude or restrict the liability of one of the parties in specified circumstances. The courts do not regard exemption clauses with favour. If such a clause is ambiguous, they will interpret it narrowly rather than widely.

The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 contain complex provisions limiting the extent to which a person can exclude or restrict his business liability towards consumers. In addition, the 1977 Act subjects certain types of exemption clause to a test of reasonableness, even in a business-to-business transaction. The Office of Fair Trading runs an unfair terms unit to monitor such clauses and enforce the 1999 Regulations.

[['', [["Anticompetitive practices that have the effect of banning the resale of products from one EU territory in another state of the ED. Export bans have long been held to infringe the competition rules in Article 81 of the Treaty of Rome; they can lead the European Commission to levy fines of up to 10% of annual worldwide group turnover. Examples of practices that infringe the rules include clauses in contracts banning exports; an export ban in a written contract will be void when Article 81 applies. However, when the vertical agreements regulation 2790/99 applies it is permitted to restrict an exclusive distributor from actively soliciting sales outside its territory. It is not permissible to prevent a distributor from advertising on a website as this is regarded as 'passive' rather than 'active' selling.

In the latter case the crime in question must be one that is a breach of the municipal law of the national committed outside the territorial boundaries of the state of which he is a citizen. Extradition treaties are bilateral in character and there is a lack of uniformity in their provisions and in their interpretation. However, they invariably contain the following three features: (1) the state that has custody will not surrender the fugitive unless prima facie evidence of his guilt is submitted to them; (2)no political offenders will be surrendered; (3)no surrender will be made unless adequate assurances are given that the accused will not on that occasion be tried for any offence other than the crime for which he is surrendered."]]]],

"extraterritoriality":
[['', [['n. A theory in international law explaining diplomatic immunity on the basis that the premises of a foreign mission form a part of the territory of the sending state. This theory is not accepted in English law (thus a divorce granted in a foreign embassy in England is not obtained outside the British Isles for purposes of the Recognition of Divorces Act 1971).

"fatal accidents":
[['', [["Formerly, at common law, the death of either party extinguished the right to bring an action in tort. In addition, a person who caused death was not liable to compensate the deceased's relatives and others who suffered loss because of the death.

Thus if a person is killed in a motor accident due to the negligence of the driver, an action can be brought against the driver in the name of the deceased; any damages obtained become part of the deceased's estate. Actions for defamation of a deceased person and claims for certain types of loss are excluded from the Act and do not survive death.", 'The Fatal Accidents Act 1976,amended by the Administration of Justice Act 1982, confers the right to recover damages for loss of support on the dependants of a person who has been killed in an accident, if the deceased would have been able to recover damages for injury but for his death. The class of dependants who may sue is defined by statute and includes such persons as spouses, former spouses, parents, children, brothers, and sisters. The main purpose of the action is to compensate dependants for loss of the financial support they could have expected to receive from the deceased. However, damages for bereavement may be claimed, on the death of a spouse or an unmarried minor child, by the surviving spouse of the former or the parents of the latter; other relatives have no claim.

Absolute means that the owner's rights are not conditional or liable to terminate on the occurrence of any event (except the exercise of a right of re-entry Law of Property (Amendment) Act 1926). In possession means that the owner's rights are immediate, thus future interests do not qualify, but possession need not imply actual physical occupation (for instance, a person in receipt of rents and profits can be said to be in possession)."]]]],

"feudal system":
[['', [["A political, economic, and social system in which the main social bond was the relationship between the Lord and others and in which this personal relationship was inseparable from a proprietary relationship that existed between them. It was introduced into England as a result of the Norman Conquest (1066). At its centre was the doctrine of tenures. All the land in the country was regarded as being owned by William I as the result of his conquest, and thereafter only the Crown could own land. The subject could merely hold it on a tenure, either directly from the Crown or indirectly through an intermediate superior. Such lands as William did not retain in his own possession he parcelled out to his barons. Holding directly from him, they were known as tenants-in-chief, and the tenures on which they held were knight service (which involved a duty to render military service for a specified number of days in each year), sergeanty (the performance of personal services), or frankalmoign (services of a religious character). Tenants-in-chief subgranted portions of their lands to lesser men to hold by tenure from them, the lesser men did likewise, and so on. The process of subgranting was called subinfeudation, and a man's immediate superior was known as his mesne lord. The principal tenures by which land was held through subinfeudation were knight service, frankalmoign, and socage (the rendering of agricultural or other services of a fixed nature, including the payment of money). All these tenures were free tenures. Much land was, however, held by unfree tenure, known as copyhold: its tenant (a villein) was required to give any type of labour demanded of him.", 'The system of tenures did not continue as an active force for more than a few centuries. The services to be performed were gradually commuted to money payments (quit rents), tenures were virtually reduced to socage and copyhold by the Statute of Military Tenures (or Tenures Abolition Act) 1660,and copyhold was converted into socage by the Law of Property Act 1922. However, the theory that the subject cannot own the land itself remains at the roots of land law; what he can own is an estate in land, which entitles him to enjoy the land as much as if he did own it.']]]],

In English legal history fictions were used by the courts during the development of forms of court action. They enabled the courts to avoid cumbersome procedures, to make remedies available when they would not be otherwise, and to extend their jurisdiction. For example, the action of trover was originally based on the defendant\'s finding the claimant\'s goods and taking them for himself. In time, it became unnecessary to prove the "finding": a remedy was granted on the basis only of proving that the goods were the claimant\'s and that the defendant had taken them.']]]],

A private company may make such transactions, however, if the directors make a declaration, supported by the company's auditors, to the effect that the company is able to pay all its debts for at least one year following the assistance being given. In addition, the Companies Act 1985lays down a strict timetable for providing the assistance, which must be complied with by the private company."]]]],
"financial provision order":
[['', [['An order for periodical payments or a lump sum made for the purpose of adjusting the financial position of the parties to a marriage and any children of the family. Such orders may be made on or after the granting of a decree of divorce, nullity, or judicial separation or when one party to the marriage has failed to provide, or to make a proper contribution towards, reasonable maintenance for the other or a child of the family. On divorce, judicial separation, or nullity, the court also has the power to make property adjustment orders. In determining whether to make financial provision orders, the court has a very wide discretion under section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.It has an overriding duty to give first consideration to the welfare of any child under the age of 18 years and to try to achieve a clean break wherever possible. The Act lists seven matters that the court must take into account as part of the circumstances it is to consider. These include: the financial resources and needs each of the parties has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future; the age of the parties and the length of the marriage; the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage; the contributions that each of the parties has made to the welfare of the family, which include looking after the home or caring for the family; and the conduct of the parties, but only where it would be very unjust to ignore such conduct. A recent landmark case in this area made it clear that the implicit objective of section 25 is to achieve a fair outcome and that there should be no discrimination between husbands and wives and their respective roles (i.e. if one spouse stays at home while the other goes out to work, this fact is immaterial). A starting point should be that assets are equally divided, unless there is a good reason for not doing so. See also MAINTENANCE PENDING SUIT; PROPERTY ADJUSTMENT ORDER.']]]],

Financial relief provisions for children, other than in matrimonial proceedings, are consolidated in the Children Act 1989;for example, it is possible for unmarried parents and those in whose favour a residence order is made to obtain financial relief.

Before a state is justified in extending its nationality to a ship, or permitting a ship to fly its flag, it seems that there must be some effective link connecting the ship with the state.

"forcible entry":
[['', [['A common-law offence (as amended by various statutes) that applied under certain circumstances when force was used to gain entry to premises. The common-law offence has been replaced by a statutory arrestable offence of using or threatening violence against people or property in order to secure entry into premises (Criminall.aw Act 1977). The offence only applies if there is someone present on the premises who is opposed to the entry and the offender knows of this. The fact that the offender is the legal owner or occupier of the premises is not in itself a defence. However, there is a special defence if the offender can prove that he was at the relevant time a displaced residential occupier or protected intending occupier who requires the property for his residence and has a qualifying freehold or leasehold interest, tenancy, or licence and was seeking to gain entry or to pass through premises that form an access to his own place of residential occupation. These provisions do not apply to landlords seeking to regain possession and it is a summary offence to make false statements when claiming to be a protected occupier.

If, after this order (a foreclosure order nisi) is made, the mortgagor does not pay on the date and at the place (usually a room in the Royal Courts of Justice) named, the foreclosure is made absolute and the property thereafter belongs to the mortgagee. However, the court has discretion to allow the mortgagor to reopen the foreclosure and thereby regain his property.

(2)Any property relating to an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971or the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (see CONTROLLED DRUGS) may be forfeited and either destroyed or dealt with as the court sees fit (this includes the proceeds of the sale of drugs). (3)Property may be forfeited if it is legally possessed but used (or intended to be used) to commit a crime (e.g. a getaway car) when the owner has previously been convicted of an offence. Property confiscated under this heading is held by the police for six months and then disposed of.', 'Most leases provide for the landlord to terminate the lease when the tenant is in breach of his covenants. The landlord must follow a particular procedure before effecting forfeiture. From 24 January 1996a freeholder cannot forfeit a lease for nonpayment of a service charge unless the lessee accepts the charge or the leasehold valuation tribunal agrees. In the case of forfeiture for nonpayment of rent, the landlord must make a formal demand for the rent unless the lease exempts him from the need to do this. When other covenants have been breached, the landlord must serve a statutory notice on the tenant specifying the breach, requiring him to put it right where this is possible, and requiring compensation in money if appropriate. If the tenant fails to comply with the notice the landlord may proceed with forfeiture. This may be done through court proceedings for possession or, more rarely, by re-entry. A landlord loses his right of forfeiture if he treats the lease as continuing when he is entitled to forfeit it. This is known as waiver of forfeiture. See also CONFISCATION ORDER; RACIAL HATRED; RELIEF FROM FORFEITURE.']]]],
"forgery":
[['', [['n. The offence of making a "false instrument" in order that it may be accepted as genuine, thereby causing harm to others.

An instrument is considered to be "false" if, for example, it purports to have been made or altered (1) by or on the authority of someone who did not in fact do so; (2)on a date or at a place when it was not; or (3) by someone who is nonexistent. In addition to forgery itself, it is a criminal offence under the Act to copy or use a false instrument, knowing or believing it to be false. It is also an offence merely to have in one\'s possession or control anyone of certain specified false instruments with the intention of passing them off as genuine. It is also an offence to make or possess any material that is meant to be used to produce any of the specified false instruments. These specified instruments include money or postal orders, stamps, share certificates, passports, cheques, cheque cards and credit cards, and copies of entries in a register of births, marriages, or deaths. All the above offences are punishable on indictment by up to ten years\' imprisonment and upon summary trial to a fine at level 5 on the standard scale and/or six months\''], ['imprisonment.', 'The Act also deals with the offences of counterfeiting currency (notes or coin), with or without the intention of passing it off as genuine; possessing counterfeit currency; passing it off; making or possessing anything which can be used for counterfeiting; and importing or exporting counterfeit currency.

The stay will be granted by the court if it is satisfied that a foreign court having competent jurisdiction is available and that the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice in that court. The factors that courts generally consider in making this decision include the location of witnesses, exhibits, and documents, the language of the witnesses and documents, the citizenship of the claimants, and the law applicable to the dispute.", 'In general, the burden of proof rests on the defendant to persuade the court to exercise its discretion to grant a stay, but if the court is satisfied that another court is available, the burden will then shift to the claimant to show that there are special circumstances requiring that the trial should nevertheless take place in the first court.']]]],

"gender reassignment":
[['', [["A physiological and ultimately surgical procedure, under medical supervision, for the purpose of changing a person's sexual characteristics. The process is undertaken by transsexuals (estimated to number some 5000 in the UK). Initially discrimination in the workplace with respect to a person's sexual orientation or transsexualism was outside the ambit of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (see SEX DISCRIMINATION). The definition of sex within that Act referred to discrimination on grounds of biological gender and hence covered discrimination only between men and women. As a result of a series of test cases taken before both the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights, the UK Sex Discrimination Act must now be construed to include both sexual orientation and transsexualism within its definition. However with respect to transsexualism, as gender reassignment is an ongoing process, it was necessary to introduce supporting regulations, to clarify the protections to be given at the workplace to a transsexual undergoing this process. The Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 bring UK law into line with the decision of the European Court of Justice in P v S and Cornwall County Council 1996, the case in which discrimination on grounds of gender reassignment was ruled to be contrary to European Community law.", "The Regulations provide protection against discrimination by employers at all stages of the reassignment process, starting when an individual indicates an intention to begin reassignment. The Regulations also cover recruitment procedures, vocational training, and discrimination with respect to pay (see EQUAL PAY). The Sex Discrimination Act as amended by the Regulations outlaws direct discrimination and provides for employees who are absent from work to undergo treatment to be treated no less favourably than they would be if the absence was due to sickness or personal injury. The protection is extended to postoperative treatment on a transsexual's return to work. A defence to a claim of unlawful treatment is also provided in relation to the employment in question, if being a man or woman is a genuine occupational qualification for the job. This could arise, for example, if an employee recruited to a sex-specific post begins the gender reassignment process, or if the job involves the holder of the post to perform intimate physical body searches, or if the nature or location of the establishment makes it impracticable for the holder of the job to live elsewhere than on the premises provided by the employer and the issue of decency and privacy must be taken into consideration.", 'The Department for Work and Pensions (formerly Employment) has produced a guide to the implementarion of these Regulations. It offers further assistance to employers on such issues as: whether or not an employee should be redeployed following treatment, the amount of time off necessary for surgical procedures, and the expected point or phase of change of name and personal details and the required amendments to records and systems. Further assistance given relates to confidentiality issues: informing line managers, colleagues, and clients. The guide also offers advice on agreeing a procedure between the employee and employer regarding a changing in dress code and agreeing when individuals will start using single-sex facilities at the workplace in their new gender.']]]],

In addition, the Law of Property Act 1925provides that a conveyance of property in favour of the heir of a deceased person conveys it to the person who would be the heir under the old rules. Where these exceptions apply, an heir apparent is the person (e.g.an eldest son) who will inherit provided that he outlives his ancestor; an heir presumptive is an heir (e.g. a daughter) whose right to inherit may be lost by the birth of an heir with greater priority (e.g. a son).

"heirs of the body":
[['', [['Lineal descendants who were entitled to inherit freehold land under the rules applying on intestacy before the Administration of Estates Act 1925. A conveyance of land "to A and the heirs of his body" creates an entailed interest that devolves to descendants only, according to the old rules. Thus (1) males are first in priority and the principle of primogeniture applies, e.g. an older son is preferred to a younger; (2)in the absence of male heirs, females in equal degree share the land equally; and (3)lineal descendants of an heir represent him, thus the son of an older son who dies will inherit to the exclusion of a younger son.']]]],

Other nations are entitled only to demand from those with whom they contract a de facto capacity to bind the society that they represent.

"hijacking":
[['', [['n. Seizing or exercising control of an aircraft in flight by the use or threat of force (the term derives from the call "Hi Jack," used when illegal alcohol was seized from bootleggers during Prohibition in the United States).

There is also a Hague Convention of 1970 and a Montreal Convention of 1971 creating the offences of unlawfully seizing or exercising control of an aircraft by force or threats and of sabotaging aircraft; these conventions provide for compulsory jurisdiction as well as extradition.

"hire purchase":
[['', [['A method of buying goods in which the purchaser takes possession of them as soon as he has paid an initial instalment of the price (a deposit) and obtains ownership of the goods when he has paid all the agreed number of subsequent instalments and exercises his option to purchase the goods. A hire-purchase agreement differs from a credit sale agreement and a sale-by-instalments contract because in these transactions ownership passes when the contract is signed. It also differs from a contract of hire, because in this case ownership never passes. Hire-purchase agreements were formerly controlled by government regulations that stipulated the minimum deposit and the length of the repayment period. These controls were removed in July 1982. Hire-purchase agreements were also formerly controlled by the Hire Purchase Act 1965, but most are now regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. In this Act a hire-purchase agreement is regarded as one in which goods are bailed in return for periodical payments by the bailee; ownership passes to the bailee if he complies with the terms of the agreement and exercises his option to purchase.', 'A hire-purchase agreement often involves a finance company as a third party. The seller of the goods sells them outright to the finance company, which enters into a hire-purchase agreement with the hirer.

Under terms of the Human Pertilization and Embryology Act 1990,the legal mother is the woman who has given birth to the child, regardless of genetic parentage, unless the child is subsequently adopted or a section 30 order is made. However, the Act is not retrospective and the position of children conceived or born before the Act came into force has yet to be resolved. The legal father is generally the genetic father except when the latter is a donor whose sperm is used for licensed treatment under the 1990Act, or when the donor\'s sperm is used after his death. If a wife conceives as a result of assised reproduction. her husband may be regarded as the child\'s legal father, even If he 1S not the genetic father, as long as he consented to her treatment. However, this does not hold for all purposes. For example, in a recent case it was ruled that a peer\'s "son" born by donor insemination could not inherit his father\'s title when It was found after the peer\'s death that his wife had been impregnated by sperm from a third party (rather than from her husband) at the relevant clinic.', "It is an offence to use female germ cells from an embryo or fetus, or to make use of embryos created from such germ cells, for the purpose of providing a fertility service. Such practice is already banned by the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority. The offence is triable only on indictment and is punishable with up to ten years' imprisonment."]]]],

Children over the age of 18 can apply to the Authority for information concerning their ethnic and genetic background.']]]],
"human rights":
[['', [['Rights and freedom to which every human being is entitled. Protection against breaches of these rights committed by a state (including the state of which the victim is a national) may in some cases be enforced in international law. It is sometimes suggested that human rights (or some of them) are so fundamental that they form part of naturallaw, but most of them are best regarded as forming part of treaty law.', 'The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) spells out most of the main rights that must be protected but it is not binding in international law. There are two international covenants, however, that bind the parties who have ratified them: the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The United Nations has set up a Commission on Human Rights, which has power to discuss gross violations of human rights but not to investigate individual complaints. The Human Rights Committee, set up in 1977, has power to hear complaints from individuals, under certain circumstances, about alleged breaches of the 1966 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. There are also various regional conventions on human rights, some of which have established machinery for hearing individual complaints. The best known of these is the European Convention on Human Rights (enacted in English law as the Human Rights Act 1998)and the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights (covering South America).']]]],
"Human Rights Act":
[['', [['Legislation, enacted in 1998,that brought the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law for the whole of the UK on 2 October 2000. In the past the use of the Convention was limited to cases where the law was ambiguous and public authorities had no duty to exercise administrative discretion in a manner that complied with the Convention.', 'The Act creates a statutory general requirement that all legislation (past or future) be read and given effect in a way that is compatible with the Convention. Section 3 provides that all legislation, primary and secondary, whenever enacted, must be read and given effect in a way that is compatible with Convention rights wherever possible.', "The Act requires public authorities including courts -to act compatibly with the Convention unless they are prevented from doing so by statute. This means that the courts have their own primary statutory duty to give effect to the Convention unless a statute positively prevents this. Section 7 gives the victim of any act of a public authority that is incompatible with the Convention the power to challenge the authority in court using the Convention, to found a cause of action or as a defence. The Act introduces a new ground of illegality into proceedings brought by way of judicial review, namely, a failure to comply with the Convention rights protected by the Act, subject to a 'statutory obligation' defence. Secondly, it will create a new cause of action against public bodies that fail to act compatibly with the Convention. Thirdly, Convention rights will be available as a ground of defence or appeal in cases brought by public bodies against private bodies (in both criminal and civil cases).Section 7(5) imposes a limitation period of one year for those bringing proceedings.", 'However, only persons classified as "victims" by the Act are able to enforce the duty to act compatibly with the Convention in proceedings against the authority, and only victims will have standing to bring proceedings by way of judicial review. Most private litigants, at least in private law proceedings, will count as victims.', 'The Convention rights that have been incorporated into the Act are: Articles 2 to 12,14,16,17,18; Articles 1 to 3 of the First Protocol; and Articles1 and 2 of the Sixth Protocol (individual rights are subjects of entries in this dictionary). See ABSOLUTE RIGHT; QUALIFIED RIGHT.', 'The Act requires any court or tribunal determining a question that has arisen in connection with a Convention right to take into account the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg organs (the European Court and Commission of Human Rights and the Committee of Ministers). This jurisprudence must be considered "so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen", whenever the judgment, decision, or opinion to be taken into account was handed down.', "Section 19 provides that when legislation is introduced into Parliament for a second reading, the introducing minister must make a statement, either (1) to the effect that, in his view, the legislation is compatible with the Convention, or (2) that although the legislation is not compatible with the Convention, the government still wishes to proceed. If it is not possible to read legislation so as to give effect to the Convention, then the Act does not affect the validity, continuing operation, or enforcement of the legislation. In such circumstances, however, section 4 empowers the high courts to make a declaration of incompatibility. Section 10 and schedule 2 provide a 'fast-track' procedure by which the government can act to amend legislation in order to remove incompatibility with the Convention when a declaration of incompatibility has been made.", 'The Act gives a court a wide power to grant such relief, remedies, or orders as it considers just and appropriate, provided they are within its existing powers. Damages may be awarded in civil proceedings, but only if necessary to afford just satisfaction; in determining whether or not to award damages and the amount to award, the court must take account of the principles applied by the European Court of Human Rights.', "Sections 12 and 13 provide specific assurances as to the respect that will be afforded to freedom of expression and freedom of thought, conscience, and religion: these are 'comfort clauses' for sections of the press and certain religious organizations.", 'The Act does not make Convention rights directly enforceable against a private litigant, nor against a quasi-public body with some public functions if it is acting in a private capacity. But in cases against a private litigant, the Act still has an effect on the outcome, because the court will be obliged to interpret legislation in conformity with the Convention wherever possible; must exercise any judicial discretion compatibly with the Convention; and must ensure that its application of common law or equitable rules is compatible with the Convention.']]]],
"humanitarian intervention":

An illegal contract is totally void, but neither party (unless innocent of the illegality) can recover back any money paid or property transferred under It (see EX TURPI CAUSA NON ORITUR ACTIO). Related transactions may also be affected. A related transaction between the same parties (e.g. if X gives Y a promissory note for money due from him under an illegal contract) is equally tainted with the illegality and is therefore void. The same is true of a related transaction with a third party (e.g. if Z lends X the money to pay Y)if the original illegality is known to him.

Although evidence of illegitimacy is readily available from the entry in the birth register relating to the child's parents, it is usual for a short form of birth certificate to be issued, which makes no mention of the parents. Entry in the register of the name of a man who IS not married to the mother (which may only be done with the consent of the mother) is evidence of his paternity.", 'The effect of the Family Law Reform Act 1987is that, for nearly all purposes, children are to be treated alike, whether or not their parents are married to one another. The parents of illegitimate children have much the same rights, duties, and responsibilities in relation to them as they have for their legitimate children. The father of an illegitimate child is under a duty to maintain the child in the same way as his duty to maintain legitimate children (see CHILD SUPPORT MAINTENANCE), but does not automatically have parental responsibility for that child. Illegitimate children are able to inherit property under wills (unless the contrary intention is apparent) and on intestacy in the same way as if they were legitimate. However, the Family Law Reform Act 1987did not remove all distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate children, notably in relation to entitlement to British citizenship and succession to the throne of England and to titles of honour.', 'It is now becoming more usual to use the term "child of unmarried parents" for children born out of wedlock, rather than "illegitimate child".']]]],

"immigration":
[['', [["n. The act of entering a country other than one's native country with the intention of living there permanently. Immigration into the UK is subject to control under the Immigration Acts 1971 and 1988, as amended by the Immigration and Nationality Act 1999. This control extends to all potential entrants except those to whom the Act gives the right of abode in the UK and except citizens of the Republic of Ireland. Nationals of other member states of the EU will also be exempted from control as from a date to be set by the Secretary of State. As originally enacted, the Act gave the right of abode to all citizens of the UK and Colonies who either owed their status to their own (or a parent's or grandparent's) birth, registration, or naturalization in the UK or were or became at any time settled in the UK and had at that time been ordinarily resident there for at least five years. Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode if one of their parents was a citizen of the UK and Colonies by reason of birth in the UK. A person having the right of abode was termed a patrial. As from 1 January 1983 the Act was amended by the British Nationality Act 1981 to confine the right of abode to British citizens as defined by that Act (see BRITISH CITIZENSHIP) and to commonwealth citizens enjoying it before the Act came into force; the term patrial was discarded. With minor exceptions, a person subject to immigration control may not enter or remain in the UK except with leave, which may be granted either indefinitely or for a limited period; if leave is granted for a limited period, an immigrant is subject to further conditions (e.g. conditions restricting employment). The 1971 Act itself gave indefinite leave to stay to those not entitled to the right of abode but who were lawfully settled in the UK when it came into force. Whether or not leave is needed, whether it should be granted, and whether a time limit and any other conditions should be imposed are decided initially by immigration officers acting in accordance with immigration rules made by the Secretary of State. Appeals against the decisions of immigration officers are made to adjudicators at the ports of entry, and thence to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.", "Under the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987,the owners of ships and aircraft are liable to pay a penalty of ￡1000in respect of any person who arrives in the UK on their ship or aircraft and who seeks leave to enter the UK without proper documents (e.g. passport or visa). Under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996,from 27 January 1997it has been a criminal offence for an employer to employ anyone subject to immigration control. Breach of this Act leads to fines of up to ￡5000. Employers must ask new employees taken on or re-employed after that date for evidence of residential status, such as national insurance documents and EU passports; this request must be made in a nondiscriminatory way, which does not breach racial discrimination legislation."]]]],

"insanity":
[['', [['n. (in criminal law) A defect of reason, arising from mental disease, that is severe enough to prevent a defendant from knowing what he did (or what he did was wrong). A person accused of a crime is presumed sane and therefore responsible for his acts, but he can rebut this presumption and escape a conviction if he can prove (see BURDEN OF PROOF) that at the time of committing the crime he was insane. For purposes of this defence, insanity is defined by the McNaghten Rules. These were formulated by judges after the trial of Daniel McNaghten (1843), who killed the Prime Minister\'s secretary by mistake for the Prime Minister, under the delusion that the government was persecuting him, and was acquitted on the grounds of insanity. According to the rules, the defendant must show that he is suffering from a defect of reason arising out of "a disease of the mind". This would usually include most psychoses, paranoia, and schizophrenic diseases, but psychopaths and those suffering from neuroses or subnormality would not normally fall within the terms of the rules. The defendant must also show that, as a result of the defect of reason, he either did not know the "nature and quality" of his acts, i.e. he did not know what he was doing (for example, if he put a child on a fire, thinking it was a log of wood) or he did not know that his acts were wrong, even if he knew their nature and quality (for example, if he knew he was murdering, but did not know that this was wrong). If the defendant is suffering from an insane delusion, he is treated as though the delusion was true and will have a defence if there would normally be one on those facts (for example, if he kills someone under the insane delusion that he is acting in self-defence, since self-defence is a defence). Medical evidence may be brought, but the jury are entitled to form their opinion on the facts. If found to be insane the defendant is given a special verdict of "not guilty by reason of insanity" and may be admitted to hospital. In cases of homicide, the accused must be sent to hospital (usually a special hospital, such as Broadmoor). Because of the consequences of successfully pleading it, in practice insanity was usually only pleaded to avoid the death penalty. However, a defendant who puts his mental state in issue (e.g.by raising a defence of diminished responsibility on a murder charge) might have to change his plea to guilty to avoid being treated as pleading insanity (though he is entitled to appeal against an insanity verdict).', "Magistrates' courts are not empowered to return a special verdict. They will either grant a complete acquittal, if the defendant's evidence of mental abnormality amounts to a denial that he had any necessary mens rea for the crime, or they may make a hospital order, if the crime with which he is charged is one for which they could usually imprison him.", 'If someone in custody for trial is suffering from mental illness or severe subnormality, he may be detained in hospital and not brought to trial until he is fit. A person who is insane at the time of his trial, in the sense that he does not understand the charge and cannot properly instruct his lawyers, may be found unfit to plead.

"insurance":
[['', [['n. A contract in which one party (the insurer) agrees for payment of a consideration (the premium) to make monetary provision for the other (the insured) upon the occurrence of some event or against some risk. For such contracts to be enforceable, there must be some element of uncertainty about the events insured against and the insured must have an insurable interest in the subject matter of the contract. (The term assurancehas the same meaning as insurance but is generally used in relation to events that will definitely happen at some time or another (especially death), whereas insurance refers to events that mayor may not happen.) There are two types of insurance: indemnity insurance, which provides an indemnity against loss and in which the measure of the loss is the measure of payment (e.g.a fire policy); and contingency insurance, which involves payment on a contingent event and in which the sum paid is not measured by the loss but stated in the policy (e.g.a life policy).A contract of insurance is one requiring the utmost good faith (see UBERRIMAE FIDEI) and is voidable if a party fails in preliminary negotiations to disclose a fact material to the risk (see NONDISCLOSURE; VOIDABLE CONTRACT). Innocent or fraudulent misrepresentation may also render the contract voidable, or the contract may be terminated for breach of an essential term (see WARRANTY). Particular types of insurance include life assurance, fire insurance, motor-vehicle insurance (see THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE), marine insurance, liability insurance, and guarantee insurance. There is considerable statutory regulation of insurance business.', "Insurers are either insurance companies or Lloyd's underwriters. Insurance companies are regulated by statute, aimed, among other things, at ensuring the insurance companies have sufficient funds to meet all claims made on them. Insurance brokers negotiate insurance contracts with insurance companies or Lloyd's underwriters on a commission basis and usually handle claims on their clients' behalf. In the event of a claim the insured receives either the amount agreed in the policy or an appropriate sum that is calculated by an independent insurance assessor."]]]],

A person is assumed to intend those consequences of his acts that are inevitable but cannot be presumed to intend a consequence merely because it is probable or natural. In the latter case, the jury must decide, on all the available evidence, whether or not in fact the accused did intend the consequences. For purposes of the law of murder, however, a person is presumed to intend to cause death if he foresees that it is a highly likely consequence of his acts. This is sometimes known as oblique intention. Intention is often contrasted with recklessness and should not be confused with motive. For some purposes, offences are divided into crimes of basic intent or specific intent (see INTOXICATION).

A crime is one of specific intent if the mens rea required goes beyond the actus reus (for example, theft, in which the actus reus is merely appropriating someone else's property, but the mens rea -in addition to the intention of appropriating it -requires an intention to deprive the owner of it for good). Intoxication will not be a defence, however, if the crime is one of specific intent that can be committed by being reckless and the indictment is framed in terms of recklessness. For example, if a drunken person sets fire to a building and endangers the lives of people in it, he may be guilty of destroying property being reckless as to whether life would be endangered, even though he was unaware of the risk. He could not, however, be guilty of damaging property intending to endanger life. Intoxication is not a defence if a person deliberately drinks or takes drugs in order to give himself Dutch courage to commit a crime."]]]],

"joint tenancy":
[['', [['Ownership of land by two or more persons who have identical interests in the whole of the land (compare TENANCY IN COMMON). A joint tenancy can only arise when four conditions (the four unities) are satisfied. (1) Each joint tenant must be entitled to possession at the same time. (2)The estate or interest each has in the land must be identical; each joint tenant is entitled to the whole property and has no exclusive entitlement to any separate part of it (see UNDIVIDED SHARES). (3) Each must have the same title to the land, i.e. their ownership must be traced from the same instrument, such as a conveyance "to A and Bas joint tenants". (4)Each joint tenant\'s interest must vest at and subsist for the same time. Under a joint tenancy the right of survivorship applies: thus ownership of the entire interest in the property passes automatically on the death of one joint tenant to the survivor(s). The last survivor becomes the sole and absolute owner.', 'Under the Law of Property Act 1925 a distinction is made between a legal and an equitable joint tenancy. When two or more persons hold the legal estate, they invariably hold it as joint tenants, and the right of survivorship applies. When the conveyance to them contains no words indicating that they are entitled to the property in undivided shares (words of severance), they hold as joint tenants in equity and the right of survivorship again applies. However, when they take distinct and separate shares, or when the equitable joint tenancy has been terminated (as by notice of severance, partition, etc.), the equitable interest is held by them as tenants in common. However the equitable (or beneficial) interests are structured, the legal estate is always held by joint tenants as trustees upon a statutory trust of land (Trust of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996; TOLATA), and the trustees are accountable to those who hold the equitable interests -in the proportions to which they are entitled if they are tenants in common -for the property. The owners in equity have many rights under the trust of land, such as the right to be consulted and the right to occupy the property. Any joint tenant may apply to the court under section 14 of TOLATA for an order relating to the exercise by the trustees of any of their functions, including sale of the property. The court may make such order as it thinks fit.']]]],

For example, if two men searching for a gas leak both applied a naked light to a gas pipe and caused an explosion, they are joint tortfeasors. But if a single injury is caused by several people acting without a common design they are not joint, but concurrent tortfeasors. An example of concurrent tortfeasors would be two motorists in separate cars, both driving negligently and causing a collision in which a pedestrian is injured. In both cases, the injured claimant is entitled to sue any or all of the tortfeasors for his whole loss; if he obtains a judgment against one tortfeasor that is not satisfied, he may proceed against the others. A tortfeasor liable for damage may recover contribution from other tortfeasors (whether joint or concurrent) liable for the same damage. See CIVIL LIABILITY CONTRIBUTION.']]]],

His effective citizenship will depend upon the jurisdiction within which he happens to be in; in the United States he is a US citizen; in France, a Frenchman; in any other country he is both.', 'Conflicts resulting from the simultaneous presence of these contrasting claims of allegiance are generally settled between states by deferring jus sanguinis to jus soli when the state asserting its primary claim of allegiance has de facto jurisdiction of the individual in question.

Important examples of land charges created by act of the parties include mortgages not protected by deposit of title deeds, binding contracts for sale (including options and rights of pre-emption), restrictive covenants that affect freehold land, and equitable easements. Some land charges arise under statute; for example, a spouse's right to occupy the matrimonial home under the Matrimonial Homes Act 1983 (a Class F land charge) and the Inland Revenue charge for unpaid inheritance tax (a Class D land charge). Local land charges, which arise in favour of local authorities from the exercise of their statutory powers, are registered by the local authority itself and apply to registered land as well as to unregistered land."]]]],

For the interests capable of being registered, see REGISTRATION OF ENCUMBRANCES. Registration of land charges against the name of the estate owner constitutes notice to everyone of their existence and generally renders them binding upon purchasers of any interest or estate in the land affected. A person contemplating taking such an interest may apply to the Department for an official search certificate, which will reveal all interests registered against the estate owner's name."]]]],
"land registration":
[['', [['The system of registering, at local branch offices of HM Land Registry, certain legal estates or interests in land. Under the Land Registration Act 1925 compulsory registration was to be introduced in a specified area by Order in Council; registration has now been extended to the whole of England and Wales, and over 90% of all land in England and Wales is now registered land. There is, however, no obligation on existing owners to register, but most transactions in land, including sale, gift, legal mortgage, etc., now trigger registration by the new or existing owner. If he fails to do so he does not acquire the legal estate and therefore runs the risk that the vendor or landlord may sell to someone else who can acquire a better title by registration. Existing owners or tenants under a lease having at least 21 years to run may register their titles if they wish.', 'Upon registration of a title the Land Registry allocates a title number. Evidence of title is provided by the issue of a land certificate to the owner (who is known as the registered proprietor) or, if the land is in mortgage, a charge certificate to the mortgagee. The certificate represents the registered title, which is in three parts, comprising; (1) The property register. This describes the land and any additional rights incidental to it, such as rights of way over adjoining land. The filed plan shows the location of the land, usually with a general indication of the position of the boundaries. Registration of precise boundaries is possible under a special procedure involving notice to adjoining owners and hearing their objections. (2)The proprietorship register. This names the registered proprietor(s) of the land and notes any restriction on their powers to dispose of it (for example, restrictions, inhibitions, cautions, etc.). The register also states the nature of the title, which may be absolute, qualified, possessory, or good leasehold. (3)The charges register. This details interests adverse to the proprietor, such as mortgages, restrictive covenants, or easements to which the land is subject.', "The land certificate fulfils a similar function to title deeds to unregistered land, but if a more up-to-date record of the state of the registered title is required (for example, by a prospective purchaser or mortgagee), the Land Registry will issue office copies or a certificate of official search on application by the registered proprietor or any person with his authority to inspect the register. A registered proprietor's title is guaranteed by the state subject to overriding interests, which are not registrable in the charges register. The extent of the guarantee depends on the nature of the title. The register can be rectified by the court in certain circumstances to correct a mistake; compensation is generally paid by the government to a party who suffers loss as a result."]]]],

A landlord may provide services to the tenant, such as heating, lighting, and porterage.

(1) When property is bequeathed to two or more persons as joint tenants, those who survive the testator take the property. (2)The Wills Act 1837provides that when property is bequeathed to a child or remoter descendant of the testator who predeceases him but leaves descendants of his own who are alive at the testator's death, those descendants take the property (subject to a contrary intention being expressed in the will). A similar rule applies when property is left in tail (entailed interest). (3)Some gifts to charities that cease to exist before the testator's death may be applied cy-pres.

The offer remains available for acceptance if the death is unknown to the offeree and the resulting contract could be performed by the offeror's personal representatives. An offer lapses if one or more conditions are not fulfilled.

(in land law) Permission to enter or occupy a person's land for an agreed purpose. A licence does not usually confer a right to exclusive possession of the land, nor any estate or interest in it: it is a personal arrangement between the licensor and the licensee. A bare licence (i.e. gratuitous permission to enter or occupy the licensor's land) can be revoked at any time and cannot be assigned by the licensee to a third party (see BARE LICENSEE). A contractual licence cannot be revoked during the period the parties intended it to last. Neither type is by itself binding on third parties acquiring the land from the licensor. However, if the licence is coupled with a grant of property or of an interest in land, the licence may be irrevocable and binding on the licensor's successors in title. For example, if A grants to B the right to catch and remove fish from water on his land, a licence to enter A's land to take up this profit prendreis necessarily implied and will be irrevocable for the duration of the profit. The profit, as a legal interest over A's land, will bind A's successors in title, as will the licence that is irretrievably bound up with it.

"lien":
[['', [["n. [via Old French from Latin ligamen, a binding] n. The right of one person to retain possession of goods owned by another until the possessor's claims against the owner have been satisfied. The lien may be general, when the goods are held as security for all outstanding debts of the owner, or particular, when only the claims of the possessor in respect of the goods held must be satisfied. Thus an unpaid seller may in some contracts be entitled to retain the goods until he receives the price (see alsoUNPAID VENDOR'S LIEN), a carrier may have a lien over goods he is transporting, and a repairer over goods he is repairing. Whether a lien arises or not depends on the terms of the contract and usual trade practice. A lien may be waived and can be lost, for example when an owner in possession sells goods to a buyer ignorant of a third party's lien. This type of lien is a possessory lien, but sometimes actual possession of the goods is not necessary. In an equitable lien, for example, the claim exists independently of possession. If a purchaser of the property involved is given notice of the lien it binds him; otherwise he will not be bound. Similarly a maritime lien, which binds a ship or cargo in connection with some maritime liability, does not depend on possession and can be enforced by arrest and sale (unless security is given). The lien accordingly travels with the ship or cargo when possession changes, and is good against a bona fide purchaser without notice. Examples of maritime liens are the lien of a salvor, that of seamen for their wages and of masters for their wages and outgoings, that of a bottomry or respondentia bondholder (see HYPOTHECATION), and that over a ship at fault in a collision in which property has been damaged.

In practice the imprisonment may often not be for life: the Home Secretary may order the release of a life prisoner on licence, on the advice of the Parole Board (see PAROLE) and after consulting the Lord Chief Justice (and, if possible, the trial judge). The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997provides that the Parole Board has responsibility for the release of juveniles convicted of murder, rather than the Home Secretary. When imposing life imprisonment for murder, the judge may make a recommendation that the defendant should serve a minimum term (number of years), which is usually not less than 12 years and up to 35 years. This recommendation is not legally binding on the Horne Secretary, but in practice he will almost always follow it.

In the latter case he must have statutory grounds for possession, which correspond to those required for possession of a protected tenancy. If the tenant contests this notice, the landlord must apply for a court order for possession. If this is refused, the tenant will be entitled to a statutory tenancy.

It may arise if the accused is charged with murder and had the mens rea required for murder (see MALICE AFORETHOUGHT), but mitigating circumstances (diminished responsibility, a suicide pact, or provocation) reduce the offence to manslaughter; this is known as voluntary manslaughter. It may also be committed when there was no mens rea for murder in one of two situations: (1) if the accused committed an act of gross negligence or (2)if the act, although not negligent, was criminally illegal and also involved an element of danger to the For example, it would be manslaughter to knock some bricks off a bridge into the path of a train (criminal damage), killing the driver, even if one had no idea that there was a train in the area. Such cases are known as involuntary manslaughter. There are generally four types of involuntary manslaughter, although the distinction between them remains unclear: negligent manslaughter, constructive manslaughter, reckless manslaughter, and corporate manslaughter. The maximum punishment for manslaughter is life imprisonment, although this is rarely imposed; however, the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997provides for a mandatory life sentence for those convicted of manslaughter for a second time (see REPEAT OFFENDER). Most cases of causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving are usually not charged as manslaughter but as special statutory offences under the Road Traffic Act 1991.

The current law is contained in the Employment Rights Act 1996 as supplemented by the Maternity and Parental Leave Regulations 1999. The provisions with respect to maternity pay are governed by the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and its supporting regulations. It is for an employer to agree contractually to more generous maternity leave provisions than the statutory minimum. There are currently seven statutory rights:', '(1) All pregnant employees are entitled to reasonable time off work, with pay, for antenatal care, but an employer is entitled to ask for evidence of appointments. An employee who is unreasonably refused time off may complain to an employment tribunal.', '(2)An employee is entitled not to be dismissed because of pregnancy or any reason connected with it. She is treated as having been unfairly dismissed if the principal reason for the dismissal is that she is pregnant, or that she has given birth, or that she has taken maternity leave.', "(3) A pregnant employee who meets certain qualifying conditions based on her length of service and average earnings is entitled to receive statutory maternity pay from her employer for up to 18 weeks (to be increased to 26 weeks from April 2003). To qualify for statutory maternity pay a pregnant employee must have been working for the same employer continuously for at least 26 weeks ending in the 15th week before the week the baby is due, must have been paying national insurance, and must leave work between the 11th and 6th week before the expected date of confinement. If she can satisfy these conditions, she will receive 90% of salary for six weeks followed by a fixed statutory rate for the remaining 12 weeks (set at ￡75 from April 2002 and ￡100from April 2003). An employee who does not qualify for statutory maternity pay but who earns at least ￡30 per week on average may be entitled to claim the state maternity allowance from the Benefits Agency. Employers can recover 92% of such payments by setting the amount against their national insurance payments. They can require the employee to provide them with evidence of the baby's birth.", "(4) An employee who continues to be employed by her employer until the beginning of the 11th week before the expected week of confinement is entitled to maternity leave. All pregnant employees are entitled to at least 18 weeks' maternity leave (to be increased to 26 weeks from April 2003). Additional maternity leave ofup to29 weeks from the actual birth of a child is also available to employees who have completed a minimum of one year's service by the 11th week before the expected week of confinement. An employee must inform her employer, at least 21 days before her absence begins (or as soon as reasonably practicable), that she intends to be absent because of maternity leave and that she intends to return to work (if she wishes to exercise that right); this notice must also state the expected week of confinement, for which she may be required by her employer to produce evidence. Women entitled to additional maternity leave in effect enjoy a maximum of 40 weeks' maternity leave, but this maximum can only be achieved by taking 11weeks before and 29 weeks after the expected week of confinement.", '(5)An employee entitled to maternity leave is also entitled to return to work with her employer after taking such leave, either in the job in which she was employed or in suitable alternative employment, provided that the employer employs more than five people. If a woman wishes to return to work before her statutory maternity leave period has expired she may do so providing she informs her employer 21 days in advance of her proposed return. If the employer refuses to allow her to return, the employee is treated as having been continuously employed up to the intended date of her return and as having been dismissed on that date for the reason for which she was not allowed to return. If she complains to an employment tribunal that she has been unfairly dismissed (see unfair dismissal), the dismissal will be treated as fair if the employer shows that it was not reasonably practicable to allow her to return, that the dismissal would have been reasonable if she had not been absent, or that in any event she would properly have been made redundant during her absence.', "(6)Throughout the maternity leave period the employee is entitled to continue to benefit from all contractual terms of her employment with the exception of remuneration (money payment). These entitlements may include such things as pension contributions from her employer, company car and personal petrol allowance, and private health insurance. The maternity leave period begins either on the date that the employee notifies her employer that she intends to begin her leave (she must give 21 days' notice, or as much notice as is reasonably practicable) or the first day on which she is absent from work because of pregnancy or childbirth, if this date is earlier than the notified date (in which case the employer must be notified of the reason for the absence as soon as is reasonably practicable and this must be in writing if the employer requests it).", '(7) Pregnant women, and women who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding, have the right to be offered any suitable alternative work, rather than being suspended on maternity-related health and safety grounds. If there is no suitable alternative work available and the employee is suspended because of her condition, then she is entitled to receive the same remuneration that she would have received had she not been suspended.']]]],

In family law, for example, mediators assist spouses to resolve disputes that have arisen as a consequence of the breakdown of their marriage by reaching agreement or reducing conflict over future arrangements for children or their finances.

[['', [['[Latin: a guilty mind] The state of mind that the prosecution must prove a defendant to have had at the time of committing a crime in order to secure a conviction. Mens rea varies from crime to crime; it is either defined in the statute creating the crime or established by precedent. Common examples of mens rea are intention to bring about a particular consequence, recklessness as to whether such consequences may come about, and (for a few crimes) negligence. Some crimes require knowledge of certain circumstances as part of the mens rea (for example, the crime of receiving stolen goods requires the knowledge that they were stolen). Some crimes require no mens rea; these are known as crimes of strict liability. Whenever mens rea is required, the prosecution must prove that it existed at the same time as the actus reus of the crime (coincidence of actus reus and mens rea). A defendant cannot plead ignorance of the law, nor is a good motive a defence. He may, however, bring evidence to show that he had no mens rea for the crime he is charged with; alternatively, he may admit that he had mens rea, but raise a general defence (e.g.duress) or a particular defence allowed in relation to the crime.']]]],

If the misdescription operates in the purchaser's favour, the vendor has no right to claim any compensation from him.", 'Under the Property Misdescription Act 1991, estate agents and property developers are prohibited from making false or misleading statements about property in the course of their business.

"misrepresentation":
[['', [['n. An untrue statement of fact, made by one party to the other in the course of negotiating a contract, that induces the other party to enter into the contract. The person making the misrepresentation is called the representor, and the person to whom it is made is the representee. A false statement of law, opinion, or intention does not constitute a misrepresentation; nor does a statement of fact known by the representee to be untrue. Moreover, unless the representee relies on the statement so that it becomes an inducement (though not necessarily the only inducement) to enter into the contract, it is not a misrepresentation. The remedies for misrepresentation vary according to the degree of culpability of the representor, If he is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (i.e. if he did not honestly believe in the truth of his statement, which is not the same as saying that he knew it to be false) the representee may, subject to certain limitations, set the contract aside by rescission and may also sue for damages. If he is guilty of negligent misrepresentation (i.e. if he believed in his statement but had no reasonable grounds for doing so) the representee was formerly entitled only to rescission but may now (under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 or by an action in tort for negligence) also obtain damages. If the representor has committed merely an innocent misrepresentation (one he reasonably believed to be true) the representee is restricted to rescission, subject to the discretion of the court under the 1967Act to award him damages in lieu. A representee entitled to rescind a contract for misrepresentation may decide instead to affirm it. See also MISDESCRIPTION; NONDISCLOSURE.']]]],
"mistake":
[['', [['n. A misunderstanding or erroneous belief about a matter of fact (mistake of fact) or a matter of law (mistake of law). In civil cases, mistake is particularly important in the law of contract. Mistakes of law have no effect on the validity of agreements, and neither do many mistakes of fact. When a mistake of fact does do so, it may render the agreement void under common-law rules (in which case it is referred to as an operative mistake) or it may make it voidable, i.e. liable, subject to certain limitations, to be set aside by rescission under more lenient rules of equity.', 'When both parties to an agreement are under a misunderstanding, the mistake may be classified as either a common mistake (i.e. a single mistake shared by both) or a mutual mistake (i.e. each misunderstanding the other). In the case of common mistake, there is full consensus ad idem and the mistake renders the contract void only if it robs it of all substance. The principal (and almost the only) example is when the subject matter of the contract has, unknown to both parties, ceased to exist (res extincta). A common mistake about some particular attribute of the subject matter (e.g. that it is an original, not a copy) is not an operative mistake.', "However, a common mistake relating to any really fundamental matter will render a contract voidable. In the case of mutual mistake there is no real consensus, but the contract is nevertheless valid if only one interpretation of what was agreed can be deduced from the parties' words and conduct. Otherwise, the mistake is operative and the contract void.When only one party to a contract is under a misunderstanding, his mistake may be called a unilateral mistake and it makes the contract void if it relates to the fundamental nature of the offer and the other party knew or ought to have known of it. Otherwise, the contract is valid so far as the law of mistake is concerned, though the circumstances may be such as to make it voidable for misrepresentation.", 'A deed or other signed document (whether or not constituting a contract) that does not correctly record what both parties intended may be rectified by the courts. When one signatory to a document was fundamentally mistaken as to the character or effect of the transaction it embodies, he may (unless he was careless) plead his mistake as a defence to any action based on the document (see NON EST FACTUM).', 'In criminal cases, a mistake or accident may mean that a person lacked mensrea. It has become clear in recent years that a person has a defence if he would have had a common-law defence, such as consent, provocation, or one of the general defences, had the facts been as he mistakenly supposed them to be. If someone commits a crime in ignorance that the law forbids it, he is usually guilty (ignorantia juris non excusat: ignorance of the law is no excuse).', "If a defendant makes a mistake as to the civil law that prevents him having the mens rea required to be guilty of the crime, he will normally be acquitted of the crime, even if his mistake is unreasonable (for example, if he damages someone else's property in the belief that it is his own, and this belief is caused by a mistake as to the law of property).

"mortgage":
[['', [["n. An interest in property created as a form of security for a loan or payment of a debt and terminated on payment of the loan or debt. The borrower, who offers the security, is the mortgagor; the lender, who provides the money, is the mortgagee. Virtually any property may be mortgaged (though land is the most common); exceptions include the salaries of public officials. The name is derived from Old French (literally: dead pledge), since at common law failure to repay on the due date of redemption (which in most mortgages is set very early) formerly resulted in the mortgagor losing all his rights over the property. By the rules of equity the mortgagor is now allowed to redeem his property at any time on payment of the loan together with interest and costs (see EQUITY OF REDEMPTION). The mortgagee has a right to take possession of the mortgaged property as soon as the mortgage is made, irrespective of whether the mortgagor has defaulted. However, this right (1) must only be used for the purpose of protecting or enforcing the security, (2) may be excluded by agreement, or (3) is subject to a power in the court to adjourn proceedings for possession, to suspend the execution of an order for possession, or to postpone the date for delivery of possession, where the mortgaged property is a dwelling house (Administration of Justice Act 1970as amended). This right is normally used as a preliminary to an exercise of the mortgagee's power of sale. In face of continued nonpayment of the loan, the mortgagee may sell the mortgaged property under a power of sale, appoint a receiver, or obtain a decree of foreclosure.", 'Under the Law of Property Act 1925 the only valid legal mortgages are (1) a lease subject to cesser on redemption and (2) a deed expressed to be a charge by way of legal mortgage (see CHARGE). All other mortgages are equitable interests only (see EQUITABLE MORTGAGE). All mortgages of registered land are noted in the charges register on application by the mortgagee (see LAND REGISTRATION), and a charge certificate is issued to him. When mortgaged land is unregistered, a first legal mortgagee keeps the title deeds. A subsequent legal mortgagee and any equitable mortgagee who does not have the title deeds should protect his interests by registration (see PUISNE MORTGAGE; REGISTRATION OF ENCUMBRANCES).

The main example of a serious crime that may be committed by negligence is manslaughter (in one of its forms).

The procedure is most commonly employed when the accused cannot be produced in court to plead or stand his trial owing to physical or mental incapacity that is expected to be permanent. It is also sometimes used when the Attorney General considers that a prosecution is not in the public interest. His decision is not subject to any control by the courts.

The period of notice to which each party is entitled is governed by the contract, subject to statutory minimum periods if the employee has been continuously employed in the business (see CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT) for more than four weeks. An employee who has been so employed for up to two years is entitled to a week's notice; one employed for a longer period is entitled to one week's notice for each year's continuous employment up to 12 years. Thus an employee who has been employed for 20 years must be given a statutory minimum of 12 weeks' notice, although his employment contract may entitle him to a longer period, which takes priority. An employee with four weeks' continuous employment must give at least one week's notice of his resignation.

If he is prosecuted nonetheless, he may appeal against his conviction. If the notice was posted by registered or recorded mail so that it would normally have arrived within the 14 days, the motorist cannot plead that he did not receive it within that time. It is not necessary to serve a notice of intended prosecution when: (1) an accident happened at the time of the alleged offence owing to the presence on the road of the car involved in the alleged offence; (2)it was not possible to find out the name and address of the accused (or registered owner) in time; or (3) the motorist is charged with causing death by dangerous or careless driving or drunken driving.']]]],

The notice must be clear and unambiguous and it must terminate the tenancy in relation to the whole of the rented property: a notice to quit part of the property can be valid only if specifically allowed by the tenancy. When the tenant lives in the rented property, the notice to quit must be in a statutory form that tells the tenant his legal rights. Otherwise no particular form is required for a notice to quit. The period of notice varies according to the kind of tenancy and any agreement between the parties. In the case of periodic tenancies for which no period has been agreed the following periods apply: a yearly or longer tenancy -six months; a monthly tenancy -one month; a quarterly tenancy -one quarter; a weekly tenancy one week. The notice must be given so that it expires at the end of one of the periods of the tenancy, for example in a yearly tenancy beginning on 1 January, the notice must expire on 31 December. If tenants have statutory protection this can affect the length of the notice to quit. Thus residential tenants must be given at least four weeks' notice, tenants of agricultural holdings must be given a year's notice, and tenants of business tenancies are entitled to at least six months' notice. In these cases a tenant may be entitled to continue in occupation of the rented property even after the notice to quit has expired. If the landlord treats the tenancy as continuing after the notice to quit has expired, a new tenancy may be created."]]]],

Thus, for example, lodgers and members of a property owner's family cannot sue in private nuisance.", 'Physical damage is actionable when the damage is of a type that is reasonably foreseeable and provided it does not arise solely because the claimant has put his land to a hypersensitive use. Interference with comfort is actionable when it is considered unreasonable as judged by a number of factors, the most important of which is the nature of the locality. The main remedies are damages and an injunction. Alternatively there is a limited right to abate (i.e. remove) the nuisance.', 'Public nuisance is a crime. At common law it includes such activities as obstruction of the highway, carrying on an offensive trade, and selling food unfit for human consumption.

At common law punishment is said to be at large, i.e. the amount of the fine or length of the prison sentence is entirely at the judge's discretion.

A marriage may be null in the sense that it is void, i.e. it was never in the eyes of the law a valid marriage (and the "spouses" are legally merely cohabitants). It may alternatively be voidable, i.e, valid until made void by a court decree of annulment, which (since 1971) does not end the retrospectIvely (so that, for example, the children of a marriage that is annulled will not be regarded as illegitimate). The form of decree, however, always states that the "is and has been null and void". The main grounds for nullity are: close relationship, lack of age, lack of consent, and nonconsummation (see CoNSUMMATION OF AMARRIAGE).

"obscene publications":

Under the Obscene Publications Acts 1959 and 1964 it is an offence to publish an obscene article or to have an obscene article for publication for gain. For the purposes of the Acts, obscenity is not limited to pornographic or sexually corrupting material: a book advocating drug taking or violence, for instance, may be obscene. Whether or not particular material is obscene is a question of fact in each case, to be decided by the jury, and expert evidence is not usually permitted. Material that merely tends to shock or disgust is not obscene. The intention or motive of the author in writing or depicting the material is irrelevant.', '"Publishing" an obscene article includes distributing, circulating, giving, hiring, or lending the article, offering it for sale or hire (the latter does not include displaying such material in a shop, which is merely an invitation to treat and not an offer), or transmitting it through the telephone system by means of a modem. An "article" may be material that is to be looked at or played over, rather than read, and can also include, for instance, a negative of a film or any article used to reproduce material to be read or looked at. This offence is one of strict liability, but there is a defence of lack of knowledge, if the defendant can show he had not examined the article and had no reason to suspect that publishing it would constitute an offence. There is also a special defence of public good, which applies when the defendant shows that publication of the article was justified as being in the interests of science, literature, art, or learning. The offence of possessing an obscene article in the expectation that it will be published for financial gain is also subject to the defences of lack of knowledge and public good. If a magistrate suspects that obscene articles are kept in any premises for this purpose, he may issue a warrant authorizing the police to search for and seize the articles. If they prove to be obscene, the magistrate may order them to be forfeited.', 'The Acts do not apply to material published by means of television or but they do apply to cinema screening and theatre performances, subject to the rule that prosecutions in such cases require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General, respectively.

It is not, however, an offence merely not to answer, or to advise someone not to answer, police questions that he does not have to answer. A police officer is acting in the course of his duty if he is preventing or detecting crime (in particular, breaches of the peace) or obeying the orders of his superiors. However, he is not acting in the course of his duty when he is merely assisting the public in some way unconnected with crime. When the obstruction amounts to an assault, the offence is punishable by imprisonment and/or a fine. One may be guilty of this offence even if the police officer was in plain clothes. There is no power of arrest unless accompanied by a breach of the peace.']]]],

Denmark acquired Greenland in this way, and the UK acquired Rockall. A belligerent occupant cannot acquire or annex the occupied territory during the course of the war. Certain provisions for the protection of enemy civilians in the Hague and Geneva Conventions are applied to those parts of the enemy territory that have been effectively occupied. A belligerent occupier must retain in force the ordinary penal laws and tribunals of the occupied power, but may alter them or impose new laws to ensure the security and orderly government of the occupying forces and administration.

"occupier's liability":
[['', [['The liability of an occupier of land or premises to persons on the land for the condition of the premises and things done there. The occupier for this purpose is the person or persons exercising control over the premises. At common law the extent of an occupier\'s liability varied according to whether the person on the land entered under a contract, as an invitee, as a "Iicensee, or as a trespasser. The common law rules have been replaced by statutes. The English statutes distinguish between visitors and other persons on land. The Occupiers\' Liability Act 1957 imposes on an occupier a common duty of care to all his visitors (i.e. those who enter by his invitation or with his permission) to see that they will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purpose for which they were invited or permitted to be there.

Employers may postpone the leave but only if their business would be unduly disrupted. Fathers and prospective adoptive parents who want to guarantee that they can be present at the birth or placement of their child may book time off work without postponement. No notice is required to be given by employees returning to work, and on return employees are entitled to work in their same job.", "Currently parental leave is unpaid, but this (and parental leave in general) is currently under review.

An unmarried father can acquire parental responsibility either by agreement with the mother or by applying to court for a parental responsibility order. In determining whether to grant such an order the court must treat the child's welfare as its paramount consideration. Both parents retain parental responsibility on divorce. Other persons may acquire parental responsibility by virtue of being granted other orders.

There is no fixed age determining a child's liability for its own torts. A child may, however, be too young to form the intention necessary for a particular tort.

In practice, a Parliament's life always ends by its earlier dissolution by the sovereign under the royal prerogative; this proclamation also summons its successor. The date of dissolution is chosen by the Prime Minister. The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions, normally of one year each, which are ended when Parliament is prorogued (also under the prerogative) by a royal commission. Each House divides a session into sittings, normally of a day's duration, which end when a motion for adjournment is passed.

(1) The right of collective access to the sovereign through the Speaker. (2) The right of individual members to be free from civil (but not criminal) arrest. Since the abolition of imprisonment for debt, this privilege has been of only minor significance, but it would still shield a member against (for example) imprisonment for disobeying a court order in civil proceedings. (3) The individual right to freedom of speech. This substantial privilege means that a member cannot be made liable either civilly (e.g. for defamation) or criminally (e.g, for breach of the Official Secrets Acts) for anything said by him in the course of debates or other parliamentary proceedings. Under the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 members are also not liable for statements repeated in reports published on the authority of the House. (4) The collective right to exclusive control of its own proceedings, so that it can (for example) exclude the public, prohibit reporting, and expel any member whom it may consider unfit to sit. (5) The collective right to punish for any breach of privilege or other contempt. Examples of breaches of privilege are initiating defamation proceedings in respect of privileged words and the reporting of secret proceedings. Other contempts include any conduct prejudicial to the proper functioning or dignity of the House, e.g. by refusing to give evidence to a committee, bribing members, or insulting the House. Members may be punished for contempt by expulsion, suspension, or imprisonment; others by reprimand or imprisonment. Imprisonment is terminated by prorogation. Whether or not particular conduct amounts to a contempt, and if so what punishment (if any) is appropriate, is considered by the Committee of Privileges, whose report the House is free to accept or reject after debate.'], ['The privileges of the Lords are similar, except that members have an individual right of access to the sovereign and the House can fine for contempt and imprison for a fixed term, which is not affected by prorogation.']]]],

If the defendant to a claim alleges that a third party is liable to indemnify him or contribute to any judgment, or is someone that they seek to counterclaim against in addition to the claimant, he must bring that party into the proceedings by issuing a Part 20 claim form. Once done, the third party becomes known as the Part 20 defendant. A defendant can issue a Part 20 claim form without requiring permission of the court if it is issued before or at the time of the filing of his defence. Directions in such a case will be dealt with as part of the normal system of case management appropriate to the track to which the case has been allocated. If the time in which the defence must be filed has expired, permission is required from the court. This is normally sought by the use of an application notice filed at court and supported by evidence of reasons why the third party be introduced into the proceedings.

A Part 36 offer (formerly called a Calderbank letter or offer) can be made in the period before the start of proceedings or -in respect of nonmonetary claims -after proceedings have started. Both procedures place pressure on the other party to the litigation to settle. In the case of a Part 36 payment, the other party is notified of the payment and that it may accept or reject the payment as a settlement. In the event of a rejection and the litigation proceeding to trial, the amount awarded is compared with the amount paid in. If the amount awarded is less than the sum previously paid into court, costs since the time of payment in will be awarded against the successful claimant. Part 36 offers have a similar purpose and effect in that the court will consider the contents of the offer when it considers the issue of costs, after finding liability and settling the amount of damages.']]]],

A Part 8 claim form must state that Part 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules applies and must set out the question the claimant wants the court to decide or the remedy that he seeks. Any evidence relied upon must be filed and served with the claim form. Part 8 claims are allocated as multi-track proceedings.']]]],
"part performance":
[['', [['A doctrine of equity that a contract required to be evidenced in writing will still be enforceable even if it is not so evidenced provided that one of the parties does certain acts by which the contract is partly performed. For an act to bring the doctrine into play (i.e. a sufficient act of part performance) that act must be performed by the person alleging the contract to exist and must relate unequivocally to the contract; an example would be taking possession of property alleged to have been sold (under a contract entered into before 21 September 1989) to the person who takes possession. It is unclear whether mere payment of money is a sufficient act of part performance. This doctrine applied primarily to contracts for the sale of land. However, such contracts entered into on or after 21 September 1989are required, under the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989, to be in writing (not merely evidenced in writing) if they are to be valid.

"partnership":
[['', [['n. An association of two or more people formed for the purpose of carrying on a business with a view to profit. Partnerships are governed by the Partnership Act 1890. Unlike an incorporated company, a partnership does not have a legal personality of its own and therefore partners are liable for the debts of the firm. On leaving the firm they remain liable for debts already incurred; they cease to be liable for future debts if proper notice of retirement has been published. A limited partnership is governed by the Limited Partnership Act 1907. It consists of general partners, who are fully liable for partnership debts, and limited partners, who are liable to the extent of their investment. Limited partners lose their limits of liability if they take part in management. A partnership at will is one for which no fixed duration has been agreed. Any partner may end the partnership at any time provided that he gives notice of his intention to do so to all the other partners, subject to any restriction in the partnership deed.

"passport":
[['', [["n. A document, issued under the royal prerogative by the Home Office through its executive agency the Passport Agency, that provides prima facie evidence of the holder's nationality. It is not required by law for leaving the UK,but it is required for entry into most other countries. Within the European Union, ED nationals are sent through quicker channels of entry although they are still subject to occasional passport checks, despite the Schengen Agreement reached by most EU states to abolish internal border checks, which came into force on 26 March 1995, and the of the Single Market in the ED,which came into force on 1 January 1993.Concerns such as drug smuggling have made member states of the ED reluctant to abandon internal controls. lts issue is purely discretionary and the government may withdraw or revoke a passport at will. Under the Immigration Act 1988,a person seeking entry into the UKon the basis of his right of abode there must either produce an appropriate passport or a certificate showing such an entitlement, issued by or on behalf of the UK government. The British Visitor's Passport has been abolished and only a full British passport is adequate for foreign travel. Children need their own passports. However, children included on a parental passport before 5 October 1998may continue to travel abroad on that passport either until reaching the age of 16 or until the passport is submitted for an amendment. The English courts have power to order the surrender of a foreign passport to protect the interest of children who might otherwise be removed unlawfully from the UK by a foreign parent.

[['', [['n. The grant of an exclusive right to exploit an invention. In the UK patents are granted by the Crown through the Patent Office, which is an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry. An applicant for a patent (usually the inventor or his employer) must show that the invention is new, is not obvious, and is capable of industrial application. An expert known as a patent agent often prepares the application, which must describe the invention in considerable detail. The Patent Office publishes these details if it grants a patent. A patent remains valid for 20 years from the date of application (the priority date) provided that the person to whom it has been granted (the patentee) continues to pay the appropriate fees. During this time, the patentee may assign his patent or grant licences to use it. Such transactions are registered in a public register at the Patent Office. If anyone infringes his monopoly, the patentee may sue for an injunction and damages or an account of profits.

The employer uses the week number in conjunction with the employee's tax code to determine his tax-free pay for the current tax year to date. This in turn is used to calculate the tax due. The week number relates to the period in which the pay day occurs, not necessarily the period in which the pay was earned."]]]],
"pawn (pledge)":
[['', [['n. An item of goods transferred by the owner (the pawnor) to another (the pawnee) as security for a debt. (The word is also used for the transfer itself.) A pawn involves a bailment and the pawnor remains owner of the goods; the pawnee is liable for failure to take reasonable care of them. If the pawnor fails to repay the loan at the agreed time, the pawnee has the right at common law to sell the pawn; he must account to the pawnor for any surplus after discharging his debt. Pawnbrokers are dealers licensed to lend money at a specified rate of interest on the security of a pawn. Pawnbroking is regulated by provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1974(replacing the Pawnbrokers Acts 1872 and 1960) with regard to such matters as pawn receipts, rates of interest, redemption period and procedure, consequences of failure to redeem, and realization of the pawn. Under the Act, a pawn can be redeemed at any time within six months, or longer if agreed by both parties. At the end of the redemption period ownership of the pawn passes to the pawnbroker if the redemption period is six months and the value of the debt is ￡25 or less. If it is more than ￡25 the pawnbroker may sell the pawn after giving the pawnor notice, but the pawnor may still redeem the pawn at any time until it is sold. The pawnbroker must account to the pawnor for any surplus from the proceeds of sale after discharging his debt but he may claim any balance of the debt if the proceeds are insufficient.']]]],

The rules relating to performance distinguish between a divisible contract and an indivisible (or entire) contract In a divisible contract the obligations of the parties are independent of each other, so that one party can demand performance by the other without rendering performance himself. Thus a landlord, though liable to be sued by his tenant for not carrying out a repairing covenant, is not prevented by his own default from enforcing the tenant's covenant to pay rent. Most contracts, however, are indivisible, i.e. the obligations of the parties are interdependent. Neither party can demand performance unless he himself either has performed or is ready and willing to do so. At common law, complete and precise performance was originally required, so that a party who rendered anything short of this (for example, a builder who carried out the contract work, but defectively in some respects) could recover nothing for his efforts. This extreme position was subsequently modified by the doctrine of substantial performance. A party who has substantially performed his obligations can now recover the contract price, reduced by damages awarded to the other party in respect of the defects. A tender of performance is the equivalent of performance, so that a seller who tenders the correct goods is discharged from the contract (and entitled to damages for breach) if the buyer rejects them. Vicarious performance (e.g. by a subcontractor) is good performance, except when personal performance is demanded by the contract. See also PART PERFORMANCE; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE."]]]],

The right is owned by the performer, although in commercial practice many performers enter into exclusive recording contracts in relation to their works, which give recording rights to a record company; in this case the company obtains copyright in the sound recording and the performer loses his rights for the duration of the contract. The Copyright Term Directive 93/98 harmonized EU law in this area.

"picketing":
[['', [['n. Attendance by employees and their trade union representatives at or near a place of work for the purpose of persuading others to work or not to work, or to exchange information, in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. There is no specific legal right to picket, nor any prohibition on picketing, but there is a concept of lawful picketing in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.Pickets have no immunity from prosecution for committing criminal offences and they have no right to compel others to stop or to listen to the pickets\' views. However, employees and their trade union representatives picketing their own place of work are immune from civil legal action for inducing others to break commercial or employment contracts with the employer involved in the dispute. Such immunity extends to persons engaged in secondary picketing in certain circumstances. Secondarypicketing occurs when the premises of an employer who is not an immediate party to the dispute are picketed. Persons picketing customers or suppliers of the employer in dispute have immunity, provided that they are likely to achieve their principal purpose of disrupting their own employer\'s trade with the employer in dispute. Thus in a dispute between an employer (A) and his workers, A\'s own employees may picket A\'s premises and employees of A\'s supplier (B) may picket B\'s premises (to prevent supplies reaching A), with the benefit of immunity from certain types of civil legal action. When an employer tries to avoid the impact of the dispute by transferring business to his associated employer, the latter and his customers and suppliers may be picketed. Again, the pickets will have immunity if they are likely to achieve their principal purpose of disrupting the supply of goods or services transferred. All pickets lose their immunity if the action is taken without being first authorized by a ballot of the members of the union involved, or if the reason for the action is that the employer is employing a person who is not a trade union member. "Flying pickets", who are neither employees nor trade union representatives of employees at the workplace picketed, have no immunity. The courts will grant injunctions to stop or prevent unlawful picketing. A code of practice on picketing is published by the Department for Work and Pensions. It is arguable that the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into the English law via the Human Rights Act 1998will impact on the law affecting picketing. Article 10, the right of freedom of expression, and Article 11, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly (see FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION), could be used to challenge some of the existing restrictions laid down in Engish law. As picketing is a form of public demonstration (in an industrial context) the imposition of restrictions could raise the civil-liberties aspects of such restrictions sufficiently to amount to breaches of either or both of these Articles. The common law may therefore be compelled, in the fullness of time, to develop a peaceful right of assembly in respect to the public highway.']]]],
"piracy":
[['', [['n. 1. (piracyjure gentium) Any illegal act of violence, detention, or robbery committed on a private ship for personal gain or revenge, against another ship, people, or property on the high seas. Piracy may also be committed on or against an aircraft. Piracy also includes operating a pirate ship or aircraft and inciting or assisting any other act of piracy. However, acts committed for political purposes are not piracy; nor are any acts committed by a warship or government ship or aircraft. Piracy is an international crime and all nations may exercise jurisdiction over pirates, regardless of the nationality of the ship or aircraft or the pirates. A ship or aircraft involved in piracy is also subject to seizure by any state. British courts have traditionally exercised such jurisdiction, and the power to do so is confirmed in the Tokyo Convention Act 1967. English municipal law has created certain offences of piracy that are not covered by international law, but they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts unless committed on board a British ship or within British territorial waters. Examples of such offences are revolt by the crew of a ship against their master and hijacking of the ship by the crew. These offences, if tried as piracy, are subject to life imprisonment (the death penalty for piracy accompanied by acts endangering life, or by an assault with intent to murder, has been abolished; see CAPITAL PUNISHMENT).', '2.

This power arises when the contractual date (stated in the mortgage document and usually very early in the period of the mortgage) has passed, but may only be exercised if interest due under the mortgage is two months in arrears, if there has been a breach of certain terms in the mortgage by mortgagor, or if notice has been served on the mortgagor to repay the loan and the loan (or part of it) has not been repaid within three months of the notice. If the mortgagee sells the property under the power of sale, he owes a duty to the mortgagor to act with reasonable care and hold on trust any money surplus to that needed to pay his mortgage debt for the mortgagor's benefit. Certain types of mortgagee (such as building societies and local authorities) have a statutory duty to take care to obtain the best price that can reasonably be obtained through the exercise of the power of sale. 2.

"power of search":
[['', [['The legal right to search people Or property. Private people have no powers of search, but various statutes, notably the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984,confer such powers on police or other officials, often on the authority of a searchwarrant issued by a magistrate or a High Court judge. The 1984Act empowers the police to stop and search any person or vehicle found in a public place for stolen or prohibited articles and to detain a person or vehicle for such a search. (An article is "prohibited" if it is either an offensive weapon or made or adapted for use in connection with burglary, theft, taking a conveyance, or obtaining property by deception.) Before such a search the police officer must state his station and object. If out of uniform, he must produce evidence of his status. He must always give his grounds for the search if asked and must record details of it. A magistrate may issue a search warrant to an officer if he is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a serious arrestable offence (see DETENTION) has been committed and material evidence is to be found on the premises. Under the Theft Act 1968,for example, police may obtain a warrant to search for stolen goods when there are reasonable grounds for believing that they are in someone\'s possession or on his premises. Under certain circumstances the police are given powers of search without requiring either a warrant or any superior authorization; for example, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (see CONTROLLED DRUGS) and the Terrorism Act 2000 (see TERRORISM). The police also have a general power, when arresting someone for an arrestable offence, to enter and search any place in which the suspect is believed to be. Statutes sometimes give powers of search to public officials, e.g. customs officers, Department of Trade and Industry officials, or Inland Revenue officers. Police powers of stop and search were extended under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Where a senior police officer reasonably believes that an incident involving serious violence may take place in his area he may issue an authorization (valid for 24 hours, extendable for up to 6 hours) for persons and vehicles (which can include caravans, ships, aircraft, and hovercraft and their passengers) to be stopped and searched if he thinks it expedient to do so to prevent violence. A constable in uniform may stop and search any person for the purpose of seeing whether that person is carrying an offensive weapon or an instrument that has a blade or a sharp point. Failure to stop is a summary offence punishable by one month\'s imprisonment and/or a fine on level 3. Failure to cooperate might amount to obstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty. Similar powers are available to senior police officers to authorize searches for periods of 28 days to prevent acts of terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland or international terrorism. Both failure to stop and wilful obstruction of a constable are summary offences for the purpose of this power and are punishable by six months\' imprisonment and/or a fine on level 5.']]]],

"precedent":
[['', [['n. A judgment or decision of a court, normally recorded in a law report, used as an authority for reaching the same deciston in subsequent cases.

It is that part of the judgment that represents the legal reasoning (or ratio decidendi) of a case that is binding, but only if the legal reasoning is from a superior court and, in general, from the same court in an earlier case. Accordingly, ratio decidendis of the House of Lords are binding upon the Court of Appeal and all lower courts and are normally followed by the House of Lords itself. The ratio decidendis of the Court of Appeal are binding on all lOwer courts and, subject to some exceptions, on the Court of Appeal itself.

[['', [['n. A supposition that the law allows or requires to be made. Some presumptions relate to people, e.g. the presumption of innocence and of sanity (see entries below).

Most relate to the interpretation of written documents, particularly statutes (see INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES). Almost every presumption is a rebuttable presumption, i.e. it holds good only in the absence of contrary evidence. Thus, the presumption of innocence is destroyed by positive proof of guilt. An irrebuttable presumption is one that the law does not allow to be contradicted by evidence, as, for example, the presumption that a child below the age of 10 is incapable of committing a crime (see DOLI CAPAX).

It also applies to airmen on actual military service and, on normal principles of statutory interpretation, to females as well as to males (for example, a female secretary aboard an ocean liner has been held to be a mariner at sea). Actual military service has been very widely interpreted. It is not confined to service as a combatant during time of war, but extends to service in any other capacity (e.g.as an auxiliary or a trainee) and to service when war is merely imminent. Service with an occupying force after a war is also included, as is service in support of the civil power against terrorists (e.g.in Northern Ireland).

Provocation is not recognized as a general defence to a criminal charge in English law, though what otherwise would have been murder may be reduced to manslaughter if provocation is shown (it is not, however, a defence to a charge of attempted murder). The test for provocation is whether the acts or words involved did in fact make the defendant lose his self-control and if so, whether they would also have made a reasonable man in the defendant's position do the same. This is a question of fact for the jury to decide in each case. A reasonable man for these purposes must be a person of the same sex and age as the defendant and sharing any characteristics of the defendant that might affect the seriousness of the provocation. For example, a sexually impotent defendant might be more easily provoked by taunts about his impotence than an ordinary man. The jury would therefore have to consider how a reasonable impotent man would have reacted. However, such characteristics as intoxication from alcohol or drugs cannot be attributed to the reasonable man. See also BATTERED SPOUSE OR COHABITANT."]]]],

The concept of retribution implies that a criminal merits his just punishment because he has done something morally or socially evil. Another aspect of retribution implies that the punishment should be related to the harm done by the crime, rather than to the moral guilt of the criminal. The utilitarian school, by contrast, believes that all punishment is evil, insofar as it adversely affects human happiness. It can only be justified, therefore, if it prevents greater unhappiness or harm. This is the basis of the theory of deterrence, in which the punishment is aimed at deterring the criminal from repeating his offences or deterring others from committing similar acts. Custodial sentences may be required to protect the public from further harm, particularly when the crimes involve violence. Sometimes these sentences are also justified as an expression of public condemnation and outrage. Recent thinking replaces the concept of retribution by the belief that sentences should be designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the criminal. To some extent these concepts are accepted in relation to young offenders, and are also reflected in the system of parole (see also SPENT CONVICTION). Legislators and judges have to bear in mind these concepts in laying down and applying sentences. They must also be aware of society\'s need for a humane system of criminal justice. Clearly the extent to which crimes should be punished without proof of intention or recklessness (e.g.crimes of negligence and strict liability) depends on which theory of punishment one adopts. Parliament has created a large number of so-called regulatory offences (e.g.road traffic offences and offences relating to production of food), which usually do not involve moral guilt and are often punished despite the absence of mens rea. It is also a matter of considerable controversy whether or not the criminal law should punish morally objectionable conduct that does not obviously harm anyone (e.g.obscene publications and various sex-related offences). The European Convention on Human Rights (signed 1950) forbids the use of "inhuman or degrading" punishment; this prohibition is now part of UK law as a consequence of the Human Rights Act 1998(see DEGRADING TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT; INHUMAN TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT). Similarly, the prohibition on the use of arbitrary punishment, as set out in Article 7 of the Convention, is now incorporated into the Human Rights Act. This provision makes unlawful the use of criminal penalties that are not prescribed by law.']]]],

For example A, the owner of Blackacre and Whiteacre, lets Whiteacre to B,who uses a track across Blackacre. If A then sells the freehold estate in Whiteacre to B,B acquires an easement of way over the track.

All offences are punishable with up to two years' imprisonment and/or a fine and require the Attorney General's consent before proceedings can be instituted. The offences are as follows. (1) Using threatening behaviour or words or displaying threatening written material. This offence may be committed in a public or private place, but it is a defence for the accused person to prove (see BURDEN OF PROOF) that he was inside a dwelling and had no reason to believe that his behaviour or display would be seen or heard by someone outside that or another dwelling. Even if the intention to stir up racial hatred is not proved, the accused can still be guilty of the offence if he is proved to have either intended his behaviour or material to be threatening or been aware that it might be so. The offence does not extend to behaviour or written material that is used solely for inclusion in a radio or television programme. A constable may arrest without warrant anyone he reasonably suspects is committing this offence. (2)Publishing or distributing to the public threatening written material. It is a defence for the accused to prove that he was unaware of the material's contents and did not suspect that it was threatening. (3) Presenting or directing the public performance of a play that involves the use of threatening words or behaviour. The actual performers do not commit or aid and abet the offence, and recordings or broadcasts of plays can only involve the offence if outsiders attend. It is a defence for the accused to prove that he was unaware and had no reason to suspect that (a)the performance would involve use of the threatening words, or (b) the offending words were threatening, or (c)racial hatred would be likely to be stirred up during the performance. (4) Distributing, showing, or playing a recording of visual images or sound to the public. It is a defence for the accused to prove that he was unaware of the recording's content and did not, and had no reason to, suspect that it was threatening. (5) Providing, producing, or directing a radio or television programme involving threatening images or sounds. The offence is limited to broadcasts by satellite, community radio services, cable, pirate stations, and the like; it does not extend to BBC or lEA programmes.

The offence does not extend to the BBC or lEA,and defence (a)above is available. The police are given entry and search powers in connection with the last offence.

The maximum penalty for rape or attempted rape is life imprisonment, but this is rarely imposed; however, the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997provides for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for those convicted for a second time of rape or attempted rape (see REPEAT OFFENDER). A husband can be convicted for raping his wife, and a boy under the age of 14 is guilty of rape if he has intercourse without consent (formerly, boys of this age were deemed incapable of rape even if intercourse had taken place).

"reasonable force":
[['', [["At common law a person may use reasonable force in self-defence and, in extreme circumstances, may be justified in killing an attacker. Reasonable force may be used in defending one's property, and if someone intrudes on one's property at night, one might be justified in this as a threat not merely to property, but to personal safety. An occupier of premises (even if he is not the owner) and possibly even a licensee (such as lodger) may use reasonable force against a trespasser. The Criminal Law Act 1967permits the use of reasonable force in order to prevent crime, to lawfully arrest a criminal or suspected criminal (or to help in arresting him), or to capture someone who has escaped irotn lawful detention. The Act extends to both police and private citizens. It is not altogether certain whether the statutory right includes the right to kill. It is a statutory offence to set spring guns or mantraps, except in a private house between sunset and sunrise. One may use a dog in self-defence if this use is reasonable (see GUARD DOG). If a person mistakenly thinks that he is entitle.j to use reasonable force when he is not, he will nonetheless be treated as if he was entitled to use such force, provided that the mistake he made was a reasonable one. It seems, however, that this does not apply if he made a mistake of law, rather than fact. See also FORCIBLE ENTRY."]]]],

"recklessness":
[['', [["n. A form of mens rea that amounts to less than intention but more than negligence. Many common-law offences can be committed either intentionally or recklessly, and it is now common for statutes to create offences of recklessness. Recklessness has normally been held to have a subjective meaning of being aware of the risk of a particular consequence arising from one's actions but deciding nonetheless to continue with one's actions and take the risk. However, the House of Lords has ruled that, in the context of criminal damage, recklessness also has an objective meaning of giving no thought or being indifferent to an obvious risk. This definition makes the concept of recklessness far stricter and brings it very close to the traditional definition of negligence. In most cases the subjective definition applies to common-law offences and the objective definition to statutory offences. There are, however, dicta in the Court of Appeal applying the objective definition of recklessness to some common-law offences (e.g.rape)."]]]],
"recognition":
[['', [['n. (in international law) 1. The process by which one state declares that another political entity fulfils the conditions of statehood (see STATE) and that it is willing to deal with it as a member of the international community. Recognition usually takes place when a new state comes into being. Some authorities believe that recognition is constitutive, i.e.it is one of the conditions that create a state in international law (see CONSTITUTIVE THEORY). Most, however, regard it as being merely declaratory, i.e. an acceptance of a fact that already exists (see DECLARATORY THEORY).', "2. Acceptance of a government as the legal representative of the state. This may be de facto or de jure. The distinction is a fluid one, often involving a political element, since international law allows states discretion as to whether or not to accord recognition and of which kind. The according of recognition of either kind is usually an acknowledgment that the government recognized has effective control, but the decision to give merely de facto recognition may reflect a wish not to show approval of the nature of the government concerned (and at the same time to be able to continue to give de jure recognition to the ousted government). The significance of the distinction (which is of little legal consequence) therefore depends on the intention of the recognizing government. Recognition may be express or implied (for example, by entering into diplomatic relations with a new government). See alsoESTRADA DOCTRINE; TOBAR DOCTRINE. For purposes of English municipal law, the question of whether or not a state is recognized is sometimes relevant. Thus: (1) only a recognized state is entitled to sovereign immunity from jurisdiction; (2) an unrecognized state cannot sue in English courts; and (3)when a foreign law is to be applied under the principles of private international law, this can only be the law of a recognized state or subsidiary body set up by it. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office certificate stating' that an entity is or is not recognized by the British government is usually taken as conclusive evidence in the courts. Since 1980 Britain has abandoned the practice of recognizing governments-- only states are now the subject of express recognition."]]]],
"recognition issue":
[['', [["A trade dispute as to whether a particular trade union should be recognized by an employer as having the right to negotiate terms and conditions of employment on behalf of its members among the employer's workforce."]]]],
"recognition procedure":
[['', [["(in employment law) A statutory procedure introduced by the Employment Relations Act 1999(operational from 6 June 2000) by which a trade union can secure the legal right to enter into collective bargaining with an employer. As well as the benefit the trade union and its members secure from the fact of bargaining, a recognized trade union becomes entitled to all employment rights bestowed by employment legislation on recognized trade unions. The new procedure enables unions to seek statutory recognition for collective bargaining if they fail to secure a voluntary agreement with the employer concerned. The statutory procedure is given in Schedule A1of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.Statutory recognition can be requested by one or more independent trade unions, in the first instance from the employer. Such an approach (often with the assistance of ACAS) may result in a voluntary agreement being made between the parties. Following a failure to arrive at a voluntary agreement a trade union may then refer the request to the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC). If satisfied that the trade union has at least 10% membership among the group of workers it is seeking to represent, the CAC will then proceed to establish the viability of the union's request. The CACmust satisfy itself that the proposed bargaining union is an appropriate unit and take into account such factors as the need for effective management, the relative views of the parties to the dispute, the existing national and local arrangements for bargaining, and the need to avoid fragmentation of existing bargaining units. Crucially the CACmust determine that the necessary support exists at the workplace for collective bargaining. In determining this issue a ballot may be held. However, if the CACis satisfied that a majority of the workers in the unit are currently members of the applicant union, it may decide that a ballot is not needed. If a ballot is held (and it must be held if less than 50%of the workers are union members), the result must show that a majority of those voting support the union and that those voting in favour constitute at least 40% of the workers in the bargaining unit. The CACthen issues a declaration that the union is entitled to recognition on the basis either that a majority of the workers are union members or that a majority support collective bargaining. When this declaration has been made, the parties are given 30 days to negotiate a method of conducting collective bargaining. Failure to arrive at an agreement will result in a further reference to the CAe. If after a further period of arbitration no voluntary agreement can be reached by the parties, the CACis empowered to specify a method for collective bargaining. This method then takes effect as a legally binding agreement between the parties. The new statutory procedure also contains provisions for the derecognition of a trade union. Where recognition has been secured via the statutory route, distinct procedures are laid down for the removal of such recognition. Normally derecognition is not possible within the first three years of any award of recognition arising from a voluntary agreement. However, special procedures exist for cases in which the relevant employees fall below 21 in number, the employees request derecognition, the employer requests derecognition, and the union ceases to be independent."]]]],

"registration of encumbrances":
[['', [['Registration of land charges and other interests affecting the rights of landowners. If registered, these charges are binding on third parties who acquire the land affected or any interest in it. If not registered, however, they will not bind most third parties and thus lose their effectiveness as interests or rights of occupation in the land itself. A person contemplating buying or taking an interest (e.g. a mortgage) in land should therefore search the relevant registers to ensure that there are no charges registered that would influence him against proceeding. The registers are therefore always searched in any conveyancing transaction by the purchaser or his solicitor. There are four relevant registers.', '(1) Local land charges, arising in favour of a local authority from the exercise of its statutory powers, are recorded in a local land charges register maintained by the authority concerned in relation both to registered and unregistered titles. Examples include rights to the repayment of improvement grants, compulsory purchase and smoke control orders, and planning decisions affecting the development or use of premises. Local land charges do not appear in any national register.', '(2) When the title to land is registered (see LAND REGISTRATION), encumbrances other than local land charges can be protected by registration of the appropriate entry III the charges register of the title at the Land Registry. This may be as a minor interest, protected by a notice or by a restriction or caution. Some encumbrances also rank as overriding interests and so do not require registration.', '(3) In the case of unregistered land. registers are maintained by the Land Charges Department of the following types of interest recorded against the names of persons owning land.', "(a) Land charges comprising Class A: certain statutory charges registered on the application of the chargee; Class B: similar charges registered Class C: (i) puisne mortgages. (ii) limited owners' charges, (iii) general equitable charges. and (iv) estate contracts; Class D: (i) Inland Revenue charges for inheritance tax. (ii) restrictive covenants created after 1925and affecting freehold land and (III) equitable easements created after 1925; Class E: annuities created before 1926and registered after 1925; and Class F: spouses' rights of occupation under the Family Law Act 1996.", '(b) Pending actions relating to land or any interest in it, and petitions for bankruptcy.', '(c) Writs or orders of the court imposing a charge on, or appointing a receiver or sequestrator of, land, and all bankruptcy orders.', '(d) Deeds of arrangement affecting land. Land charges remain registered until discharged by the chargee or the court. Registration of pending actions, writs and orders, and deeds of arrangement must be renewed every five years.', "(4) A floating charge on the assets (including land) of a limited company and any other charge on a company's land that was created before 1970for securing money need only be registered at the Companies Registry, under the Companies Act 1985. A fixed charge on a company's land created after 1969 should be registered both at the Companies Registry and the Land Charges Department (or charges register of the registered title as appropriate).", 'Although a chargee is protected by registration against all persons acquiring any interest in the land affected, the Law of Property Act 1969 provides that a purchaser is bound only by registered charges of which he knew or ought to have known when the contract was made. Thus if the purchaser discovers an undisclosed registered charge before completing the contract, he may rescind or pursue other contractual remedies against his vendor as the circumstances allow. If he completes the transaction, however, he will be bound by the charge.']]]],

"relevant transfer":
[['', [["A situation that may arise when a business or part of a business (the transferor) changes ownership and staff transfer to the new owner (the transferee). If the change of ownership falls within the scope of the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 1981 (TUPE), then there is an automatic transfer of an employee's contract of employment. TUPE was the UK government's response to EC Directive 77/187, known as the Acquired Rights Directive, the main objective of which was to safeguard employees' rights in the event of a change of employer. Employees are protected via TUPE where there is a relevant transfer. This, however, is not always a straightforward issue to determine. Because the Acquired Rights Directive is very wide in its scope, both the European Court and national courts have taken a wide view of what situations amount to a relevant transfer. The situations in which a relevant transfer has been held to operate are numerous. The simplest situation is where one company acquires another and staff transfer. More complex situations include contracting out services, the transfer of contracts and franchises, and the transfer of leases. TUPE operates in each of these situations if staff have followed the transfer or have lost employment as a consequence.", "There are a number of important issues to note where a relevant transfer occurs. First there is an automatic transfer of the transferor's rights and obligations arising from the employment relationship they have with their staff. Because of this the employee's terms and conditions (with very limited exceptions in the area of pension rights) must be maintained by the new employer (the transferee). Secondly, a relevant transfer cannot be the basis for dismissal unless an employee can be shown to have been dismissed for economic reasons or as a result of technical reorganization. Where an employee, being aware of a proposed transfer, informs either the transferor or the transferee that he objects to the transfer, his transfer does not take effect and his contract of employment is terminated, but he has no claim for unfair dismissal. If a dismissal occurs as a direct result of the transfer this is automatically unfair. If an employer seeks to argue a dismissal was for an economic, technical, or organizational reason, it is not automatically unfair but it can be depending on the employer's procedure.", "Finally, TUPE puts in place the need for a consultative process to ensure the free exchange of information between the transferee, the transferor, and the staff who may be affected. The transferor has a duty to inform and consult with a recognized independent trade union when any of its members may be affected by the transfer. The employer must inform union representatives in writing, long enough before the relevant transfer to enable consultations to take place, of the fact that a transfer is to take place; when this is to occur and the reasons for it; the legal, economic, and social implications of the transfer for the affected employees; and the measures the employer is to take (if any) in relation to those employees. If there are no employee representatives, information must be given to all employees. The transferee has a duty to provide the transferor with sufficient information to enable him to give these facts. During consultations the employer has a duty to consider any representations made by trade union or staff representatives and reply to them; if he rejects them he is obliged to give his reasons for doing so. If any employer fails to inform or consult, a complaint may be presented to an employment tribunal within three months of the completion of the relevant transfer. The employer can argue that his failure to perform a particular duty was due to special circumstances but that he took all reasonably practicable steps to inform and consult. Although this is a potential defence, tribunals interpret it very narrowly. Insolvency does not amount to special circumstances. If the complaint is upheld, the tribunal can order the employer to pay appropriate compensation not exceeding 13 weeks' pay for the employee(s) in question.", 'The scope of the Acquired Rights Directive has now been expanded; consequent modifications to TUPE are currently under discussion. Changes include a discretion for EU member states to extend the protection of national law to require transferees to provide equivalent pensions, and for contractual terms to be varied when a transfer is coincidental with insolvency proceedings and when the variation in a contract of employment is to ensure continuation of the organization. It will also be possible for employee representatives to negotiate changes in contractual terms following the transfer of an important business. There are new provisions dealing with employee representation as well as amendments to the procedures for information and consultation.']]]],

After arrest a suspect is normally kept at the police station until he is brought before the magistrates. If the offence with which he is charged is triable summarily or is an indictable offence that is being tried summarily (see OFFENCES TRIABLE EITHER WAY), the court may adjourn the case and remand the accused. If the offence is being tried on indictment, the court may likewise adjourn the case and remand the accused before inquiring into the offence as examining justices. Remand in custody has traditionally been made for no more than eight clear days, excluding the day on which the accused was remanded and the day on which he is to appear again before the court (the "eight-day rule"). If the accused had to be remanded for more than eight days, he was normally released on bail unless there was some special reason why bail should be refused. However, the court could remand a suspect for a further period (or any number of further periods) of eight days after the end of the original remand order. If the period of time spent on remand became excessive, the accused could apply for bail. However, following claims that eight-day remand hearings served no useful purpose and wasted prison service resources, the Home Secretary was empowered in 1988 to provide remand periods not exceeding 28 days for accused persons aged 17 or over, in particular areas or classes of case. The abolition of the eight-day rule was extended, by the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996,to those under 17for offences alleged to have been committed on or after 1 February 1997. A remand order may also be made upon adjournment of a trial at any stage, at the request of either the prosecution or the defence, or after conviction, if the court wishes to obtain a report before sentencing. Bail must normally be granted, however, when remanding for reports.', "Upon remand the suspect is sent to the local prison. Juvenile offenders may be remanded instead to local authority accommodation. Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the court may remand a juvenile offender to secure accommodation in a community home or a registered children's home, provided the charge or conviction is for a violent or sexual attack, the offence is one for which an adult could be imprisoned for at least 14 years, or there is a recent history of absconding and the charge or conviction relates to an imprisonable offence committed while remanded to the local authority.

Depending on the manner in which the rentcharge arose, it may be called a chief rent or fee farm rent, but the effect is similar. A rentcharge owned on terms equivalent to a fee simple absolute in possession or term of years absolute can be a legal interest in land, but one subsisting on other terms (e.g. for life) is an equitable interest, registrable as a general equitable charge. If the rent falls into arrears, the owner of the rentcharge may (on 40 days' arrears) enter the land and take its income until the debt is paid or lease the land to trustees who have powers to raise the money. On 21 days' arrears, he may enter the land and seize the debtor's goods as security for the rent (see DISTRESS). In general, a deed creating a rentcharge also reserves to its owner the right to forfeit the debtor's interest in the land if the rent is not paid. The Law of Property (Amendment) Act 1926 provides that freehold land subject to a rentcharge owner's right of forfeiture (a right of re-entry) can still qualify as a fee simple absolute in possession.", 'A rentcharge may also be secured on another rentcharge, rather than directly on land. For example, A grants a rentcharge (R1) over his land of ￡50 a year to B, who grants a rentcharge (R2) secured on R1 of ￡25 a year to C. If B is more than 21 days in arrear, C may appoint a receiver to collect the ￡50 from A and to pay C his ￡25 plus the expenses of the recovery, and account to B for any surplus.', "The Rentcharges Act 1977prohibits the creation of new rentcharges after 21 August 1977, except for (1) certain charges, usually in favour of the landowner's family, the effect of which is to make the land subject to a trust of land; and (2) estate rentcharges.

For example, under English conflict rules, if a person dies intestate, the succession to his personal property is governed by the law of the country in which he is domiciled. Under Italian conflict rules, however, succession to personal property in such cases is governed by the law of the intestater's nationality.

The state of being represented, e.g. by an elected representative in the House of Commons (see also PARLIAMENT), by a defending counsel in court, or by an agent acting on behalf of his principal.', "2. (in succession) Taking the place of another. The court grants to executors or administrators the right to represent the deceased, i.e. to collect, sell, and transfer the deceased's assets (in accordance with the will or intestacy rules) as if they were the owners. Under the Wills Act 1837a devise or legacy in favour of a child or remoter descendant of the testator who predeceases him leaving descendants of his own does not lapse but is reputed ownership inherited by those surviving descendants, who therefore represent their deceased ancestor (see PER STIRPES).", '3. (in contract law) A statement. A person who has been induced to enter into a contract on the basis of a statement that is untrue or misrepresents a material fact may sue for damages or for rescission of the contract (see MISREPRESENTATION). Under the Consumer Credit Act 1974a representation includes a condition, warranty, or any other statement or undertaking, either oral or in writing. Many contracts exclude all prior representations from terms of the contract, although in consumer contracts such an exclusion may be void if unfair.']]]],
"representative action":
[['', [['An action brought by or against one or more persons as representative(s) of a larger group. All the persons represented must have the same interest in the proceedings, and therefore a representative action cannot generally be brought if each member of the group has a separate claim for damages. Judgment in a representative action is binding upon all the persons represented. Such actions are not normally possible under English law, although they are common in the United States. An example of a representative action is one brought by company members on behalf of themselves and other members against the company in respect of a wrong done to them by it (e.g. a denial of their voting or class rights embodied in the articles of association or an ultra viresact). Compare DERIVATIVE ACTION; GROUP ACTION.']]]],
"reprisals":
[['', [["pl. n. Retaliatory measures taken by one state against another to settle a dispute occasioned by the other's illegal or unjustified conduct.

"repugnancy":
[['', [['n. Contradiction or inconsistency in the terms of a document. Generally the court construes documents to give effect to the parties\' primary intention (the main purpose rule). If this cannot be established and the document\'s provisions are directly contradictory, the court treats the later provision as effective in the case of a will and the earlier one in the case of a deed. Thus a transfer of property to A and B "as beneficial joint tenants in equal shares" confers a joint tenancy unless it was effected by will, when it will be treated as conferring a tenancy in common in equal shares.']]]],

(in land law) An application to HM Land Registry, the Land Charges Department, or a local authority for a certificate of official search to reveal whether or not land is affected by encumbrances.', '2. (in conveyancing) A request by an intending purchaser or mortgagee arising from the abstract of title supplied by the owner. For example if an abstracted deed shows that the land is affected by encumbrances contained in an earlier deed that has not been abstracted, the purchaser will raise a requisition demanding proper evidence of the encumbrances.', "3. (in military law) The compulsory acquisition of property for use by the armed forces. The Army Act 1955and the Air Force Act 1955, for example, contain provisions that, if brought into force by a government order made in the public interest, enable commanding officers to issue requisitioning orders authorizing the acquisition (in return for payment and compensation for damage) of vehicles, horses' food, and stores."]]]],

"resale price maintenance":
[['', [['The fixing by a supplier of the price at which his goods may be sold by others. This may be attempted by contractual arrangements or by nonlegal means, such as blacklisting by trade associations. Resale price maintenance is now prohibited by the Competition Act 1998and Article 81 of the Treaty of Rome. Provisions in contracts of sale between suppliers and dealers fixing minimum prices are void, and it is illegal to withhold supplies on the grounds of adverse pricing. Fines of 10%of turnover can be imposed for breach of these provisions. Formerly, resale price maintenance was permitted for books and certain nonprescription drugs, but even these exceptions have now been declared illegal.']]]],
"rescission":
[['', [['n. The setting aside of a voidable contract, which is thereby treated as if it had never existed. Rescission is an irrevocable step and can be effected by any clear indication of intention to be no longer bound by the contract; this intention must be either communicated to the other party or publicly evidenced in some way. Rescission can also be effected by a formal action (a remedy developed by the courts of equity). There are limits on the right of rescission. It cannot be exercised unless restitutio in integrum is possible, i.e. unless it is possible to restore both parties to their original positions, and it cannot be exercised if this would involve upsetting rights acquired by third parties. Thus, a buyer of goods cannot rescind if he cannot return the goods, and a seller of goods cannot rescind if they have been resold to a third party.', 'The setting aside of a proprietary contract by a minor is normally called repudiation rather than rescission, but there is no distinction in substance. The treating of a contract as discharged by breach (see BREACH OF CONTRACT) is frequently, but misleadingly, called rescission. It does not operate retrospectively and is permissible whether or not restitutio is possible.']]]],
"rescue":
[['', [['n. 1. Action to save people or property from danger. There is no general duty to rescue people or property from danger, though a master of a ship is bound by statute to render assistance to people in danger at sea. Voluntary attempts to rescue people in danger are encouraged by the law. Someone injured in such a rescue attempt may recover damages from the person whose negligence created the danger. The rescuer is not regarded as having assumed the risk of being injured and courts are reluctant to find that his injuries were due to contributory negligence. Attempts to rescue property may not be treated so sympathetically.', '2. The forcible removal of a person in the custody of the law, which is a criminal offence.', '3. The recovery of property that has been taken by way of distress. If the distress was unlawful, the owner is entitled to recover it.']]]],

(in international law) A unilateral statement made by a state, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving, or acceding to a treaty, in order to exclude or modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that state. This device is used by signatory states to exempt particular policies from challenge. The UK has made one reservation in relation to the right to education in Article 2 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. The Human Rights Act 1998also excludes public authorities from duties under Article 2 where this reservation applies.', "2. (in land law) The creation of an easement or other right in a conveyance of land that is for the benefit of land retained by the vendor or transferor. For example, if A is selling Blackacre but requires a right of way over it for access to land he is retaining, the conveyance of Blackacre to the purchaser will reserve the right of way for the benefit of A's retained land.

The Reserve Forces Act 1996 provides a new power allowing call-out of reserve forces for humanitarian disaster relief and operations and introduced two new categories of reserve. The high readiness reserve will consist of about 3000 volunteers who have agreed, with their employers' consent, to accept increased liability for being called out. These volunteers will be people with special skills, such as linguists and public information specialists. The sponsored reserve will undertake some support tasks currently restricted to regular personnel. The legislation also makes provision to allow reservists to volunteer to undertake productive tasks other than training without being called out. There are powers to increase the military pay of reservists called out for operations if this pay is less than their civilian pay would be. There are also powers to pay employers for additional costs when the reservists are called out. A Reserve Forces Appeal Tribunal, set up under the 1996Act, hears appeals from reservists and employers who are dissatisfied."]]]],
"residence":
[['', [['n. 1. The place in which a person has his home. The term has been defined in various ways for different purposes in Acts of Parliament.

Temporary residents are chargeable to tax in the UK if they stay in the UK for a period (or periods adding up to) six months in any year. It is possible to be a resident of more than one country at the same time. See also DOMICILE; HABITUAL RESIDENCE; MAIN RESIDENCE.', "2.

If he resists a legal arrest, however, he lays himself open to a charge of assaulting or obstructing a police officer in the course of his duty. The fact that the police officer was in plain clothes is no defence to such a charge. The House of Lords has ruled that it is the right and duty of every citizen to take reasonable steps to prevent a breach of the peace by detaining the offender. The offender therefore has no right to resist such an arrest on the grounds of self-defence; if he uses force to do so, he may be guilty of an assault."]]]],

"restitution":
[['', [['n. The return of property to the owner or person entitled to possession. If one person has unjustifiably received either property or money from another, he has an obligation to restore it to the rightful owner in order that he should not be unjustly enriched or retain an unjustified advantage. This obligation exists when, for example, goods or money have been transferred under compulsion (duress), under mistake, or under a transaction that fails because of illegality, lack of formality, or for any other reason or when the person who has taken the property has acquired a benefit through his actions without justification.', "In certain circumstances the courts may make a restitution order in respect of property. Under the Theft Act 1968, if someone is convicted of any offence relating to stolen goods the court may order that the stolen goods or their proceeds should be restored to the person entitled to recover them. The court will only exercise this power, however, in clear cases that do not involve disputed questions of fact or law. Under the Police (Property) Act 1897, magistrates' courts are empowered to make a restitution order in favour of a person who is apparently the owner of property that has been obtained by the police in connection with any crime, even when no charge can be brought or the goods are seized under a search warrant. If the owner cannot be found, the court may make any order it thinks fit (usually an order for sale by auction). The police have no power to retain property lawfully seized merely because they think the court will probably make a restitution order."]]]],

"restrictive covenant":
[['', [["An obligation created by deed that curtails the rights of an owner of land; for example, a covenant not to use the land for the purposes of any business. A covenant imposing a positive obligation on the landowner (the covenantor), for example to repair fences, is not a restrictive covenant. Third parties who acquire freehold land affected by a restrictive covenant will be bound by it if it is registered (see REGISTRATION OF ENCUMBRANCES) or, in the case of covenants created before 1926,if they are aware or ought to be aware of it (see CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE). The covenant may also be enforceable by successors of the original beneficiary (the covenantee) if it was annexed to (i.e. expressly taken for the benefit of) the covenantee's land or if the benefit of it was expressly assigned. Section 78(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925has been interpreted as providing a form of statutory annexation. Thus, unless there is an express stipulation to the contrary, all covenants shall be deemed binding on successors to the original covenantee. The benefit of a covenant will not be annexed, however, if the covenantee's land is not actually capable of benefiting from the covenant; for example, if it is too far away to be affected.

"Restrictive Practices Court":
[['', [['A superior court of record created by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956.lts jurisdiction was to determine matters arising under the legislation controlling restrictive trade practices and resale price maintenance, principally determining whether or not restrictive agreements registered with the Director General of Fair Trading were contrary to the public interest.

Examples include resale price maintenance contracts, agreements between manufacturers to restrict output so that demand remains unsatisfied and a high price is maintained, similar agreements concerning the provision of services, and rules restricting entry to a trade or profession. Under the Competition Act 1998, certain types of restrictive agreement are presumed to be against the public interest (and therefore void) unless they are first registered with the Director General of Fair Trading and then justified to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The OFT can declare whether or not an agreement is contrary to the public interest and make orders restraining the parties from giving effect to it and from making a new similar agreement. It can also decide whether or not goods of any particular class should be exempt from the statutory prohibition on resale price maintenance.', 'Agreements that are important to the national economy or hold down prices may be exempted by the Secretary of State.

[['', [['A trust arising by operation of law and in some cases based on the unexpressed but presumed intention of the settlor. When the beneficial interest of a trust is not completely disposed of, the undisposed interest results (i.e. goes back) to the settlor or to his estate. A resulting trust is also created when purchased property is transferred to someone other than the person who provides the price (compare ADVANCEMENT); it may also arise when property is transferred voluntarily. Resulting trusts may be regarded either as similar to implied trusts or as a category of them. There is sometimes no clear distinction between a resulting trust and a constructive trust, and the courts sometimes appear to use the terms interchangeably.']]]],

A will is automatically revoked by the testator's valid marriage, unless it appears from the will that at the time it was made the testator was expecting to marry a particular person and that he intended his will not to be revoked by the marriage. A particular disposition in a will may similarly take effect in spite of the marriage. The dissolution of a marriage does not revoke a will but the Wills Act 1837 provides that in the event of divorce or annulment any devise or bequest to a former spouse lapses in the absence of contrary intention in the will."]]]],

"right of silence":
[['', [['The right of someone charged with an offence or being tried on a criminal charge not to make any statement or give any evidence. Often cited as a prime example of the fairness of the English criminal system, being intended to protect the innocent, it was also criticized as unduly hampering the conviction of the guilty and has therefore been modified. If a suspect fails to mention something at the time of his arrest or charge that is later relied on in his defence, this may result in a court at a subsequent trial drawing such inferences as appear proper (see CAUTION). Sometimes, however, statute obliges him to answer, as in certain fraud investigations by the Serious Fraud Office (although this has been held contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights).', "Failure of an accused aged 14 or over to give evidence in his own defence or refusal to answer questions without good cause will also allow such inferences to be drawn. Inferences may also be drawn from a suspect's failure to account for any object, mark, or substance found on his person, in his clothing or footwear, or otherwise in his possession at the time of arrest.

It is also an offence to refuse to give one's name and address to anyone who reasonably requires it (e.g. a police officer or another driver or pedestrian involved in the accident), unless one reports the accident to the police as soon as possible (not later than 24 hours after it occurred). If a person has been injured in a road accident, it is an offence not to produce one's certificate of insurance (see THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE) for a police officer or anyone else with reasonable grounds for asking for it, unless one reports the accident to the police not later than 24 hours after it occurred and, at the same time or within five days, produces the certificate of insurance at any police station one specifies.

It is also robbery to threaten to use physical force in these circumstances, even if the person threatened is not frightened by the threats. The degree of force required is a question of fact in each case to be decided by the jury; nudging someone so that he loses his balance may constitute sufficient force.

A few prerogative acts (e.g. the granting of certain honours, such as the Order of the Garter) are performed in accordance with the sovereign's personal wishes.", 'The Crown has limited powers of legislating under the prerogative, principally as respects the civil service and UK dependent territories. It does so by Order in Council, ordinance, letters patent, or royal warrant. The dissolution and prorogation of Parliament and the granting of the royal assent to Bills take place under the prerogative. Originally the fountain of justice from which the first courts of law sprang, the Crown still exercises (through the Home Secretary) the prerogative of mercy and retains the right (through the Attorney General) to stop a prosecution by entering a nolle proseqUi. In foreign affairs, the sovereign declares war, makes peace and international treaties, and issues passports under the prerogative. Many appointments (e.g. the higher judiciary, archbishops, and diocesan bishops) are made under the prerogative, and a variety of honours, including new hereditary peerages, are conferred by the Crown as the fountain of honour. The sovereign is head of the armed forces, and, although much of the law governing these is now statutory, their disposition generally remains a matter for the prerogative. There is a prerogative power, subject to the payment of compensation, to expropriate or requisition private property in times of war or apprehended war. Miscellaneous prerogative rights include the rights to treasure trove and to bonavacantia. An important immunity of the sovereign is the prerogative of perfection. The common-law maxim that "the King can do no wrong" resulted in the complete immunity of the sovereign personally from all civil and criminal proceedings for anything that he or she might do. This personal immunity remains, but actions may now be brought against the Crown under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 (see CROWN PROCEEDINGS).', 'If a statute confers on the Crown powers that duplicate prerogative powers, the latter are suspended during the existence of the statute unless it either abolishes them or preserves them as alternative powers.']]]],

The doctrine applies when the acts of a settlor are unclear. If the settlor discharges his obligation by an act different from that required, the obligation is said to be satisfied provided that the act he does is a sufficient substitute for the act he is charged to do. Thus if he owes a debt and leaves a legacy of the same or a greater amount to the creditor, the creditor is satisfied. Closely analogous to satisfaction are cases in which payment of a legacy is satisfied by payment of a portion and one legacy is satisfied by payment of another (see ADEMPTION): in these cases, however, there is no prior obligation owed by the settlor.']]]],

Most commercial agreements exclude the implied conditions and replace them with express warranties, although unreasonable exclusions in standard-form contracts, even between two businesses, may be void under the law relating to unfair contract terms.

All passenger vehicles with seating for fewer than 13 passengers and most four-wheeled goods vehicles registered after 1 January 1965 must comply with statutory regulations governing seat belts, although the details of these regulations vary according to the date when the vehicle was first registered. lt is compulsory for all drivers and front-seat passengers in cars registered after 1964, light vans registered after 1966, and three-wheeler vehicles registered after 1969 to wear seat belts at all times when the vehicle is moving, and for back-seat passengers to wear seat belts when these are fitted, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions are: (1) drivers carrying out any manoeuvre that includes reversing (passengers must still wear their seat belts during such manoeuvres); (2) drivers making local delivery or collection rounds in specially adapted vehicles (e.g. milkmen in milk vans); (3)anyone whose seat belt has become faulty during the drive or who has already arranged to have a faulty belt repaired; (4)anyone whose belt has locked on a steep hill; (5) anyone supervising a learner who is reversing; (6) certain categories of people with a special exemption certificate on medical grounds.', 'Any front-seat passenger over the age of 14 is responsible for wearing his own seat belt, but the driver of the car is responsible for ensuring that front-seat passengers under the age of 14 wear a seat belt. Children under the age of one must wear an approved child restraint. Over the age of one they can wear an adult seat belt, preferably with an approved booster cushion to raise them to a suitable height. Alternatively they can sit in the back seat fitted with an approved restraint. When more passengers are carried than there are seat belts available, the passengers who do not have seat belts do not break the law by not being restrained. Thus in a four-seater car with a fifth passenger sitting in the middle of the back seat, the middle back passenger does not break the law by being unrestrained.', 'Failure to wear a seat belt carries a fine at level 2 on the standard scale and may also be regarded as contributory negligence in a claim for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident, leading to a reduction in damages.']]]],

It arises when a testator (or more rarely a settlor) gives property to someone on that person's express or implied promise to hold the property on trust for a third party. On the face of the document the transaction appears to be an outright gift, and the existence of a trust is not apparent. Such trusts are sometimes called fully secret trusts, to distinguish them from half-secret trusts, but the term secret trust is sometimes used for both. Doctrinal difficulties have arisen with secret trusts because they appear to allow a will to be altered indirectly without the need to comply with the formalities of the Wills Act 1837, and their theoretical basis is unclear. Some recent cases have suggested that there is no conflict with the Wills Act, since the trust operates ordinary equitable jurisdiction."]]]],

Section 8 orders, which replace the old access, custody, and care and control orders, include residence, contact, prohibited steps, and specific issues orders. A residence order settles arrangements about where a child is to live. Such an order is typically made when parents live apart and cannot agree where the child is to live. Residence orders may also be made in respect of nonparents: in such a case, the order would confer parental responsibility on those in whose favour the order is made. A contact order defines the extent and nature of the contact the child is to have with other individuals. A contact order cannot be made in favour of a local authority or while the child is in care. A prohibited steps order prohibits certain specified steps (for example, taking a child abroad) being taken without the consent of the court and can be made against anyone regardless of whether he or she has parental responsibility for the child. A specific issue order deals with any specific issues concerning the child's upbringing, such as education or medical treatment.", "Section 8 orders are only necessary when there is a dispute between the parents or others in relation to a child and are usually only made in respect of children up to the age of 16.

A landlord can only terminate a secure tenancy by serving a notice on the tenant in a special statutory form and can only obtain possession with the tenant's consent or, if this is refused, by a court order. An order is granted only if the landlord has statutory grounds similar to those required in the case of an assured tenancy. When the holder of a secure tenancy dies, his spouse or a member of his family who has lived with him for the past 12 months can succeed him as tenant. Under certain conditions, secure tenants have a right to buy their rented property, at a discount on the market value of the property, and with their landlord supplying a mortgage.

A defence at common law to charges of offences against the person (including homicide) when reasonable force is used to defend oneself, or one's family, or anyone else against attack or threatened attack. The scope of the defence often overlaps with the statutory right to use reasonable force to prevent a crime, but also extends to cases in which the statutory right is inapplicable (for example, when the attacker is for some reason not guilty of a crime). There is no rule of law that a person must retreat before acting in self-defence. If a person acting in self-defence mistakenly uses more force than was necessary in the circumstances and kills his attacker, he has no defence of self-defence (since the force was not reasonable) and the killing will therefore amount to murder, unless he can show that there was also provocation. However, in deciding whether the force used was justified or reasonably thought to be justified, the jury must bear in mind the difficulty of quickly assessing the correct amount of force to be used. See also GENERAL DEFENCES.", '2. One of the very few bases for a legal use of force under international law. Under Chapter VII (Article 51) of the United Nations Charter, the inherent right of self-defence is preserved. Reference to "inherent right" has promoted the belief that the pre-Charter right of self-defence in customary international law is specifically preserved by the Charter.

Independent and self-directed action taken by an injured state against the transgressing state in order to gain redress. Until the middle of the 20th century the right of self-help was claimed by states as one of the essential attributes of sovereignty. In the absence of an international executive agency, an injured state undertook on its own account the defence of the claim it was making. Forcible measures falling short of war might prove sufficient; failing these, war might be resorted to as the ultimate means of self-help. Since self-help was regarded at international law as a legal remedy, the results secured by it were recognized by the international community as a final settlement of the case. Since the establishment of the United Nations, self-help with regard to use of force can only be legal in so far as it forms part of a legitimate claim to self-defence.

Before the sentence is imposed, the prosecution must present the judge with the accused's antecedents and the defence may then make a plea in mitigation of the sentence. If the probation officer wishes to make a report, this should be done before the defence makes its plea in mitigation (see SOCIAL INQUIRY REPORT). The judge may also obtain reports from nonlegal specialists (medical experts or social workers) on the mental, physical, social, or personal circumstances of the accused; if such reports are not immediately available, he may adjourn the case (and remand the accused) until they are obtained. Reports are desirable when the sentence may involve a community rehabilitation order or when the defendant is facing his first prison sentence. The court must have reports before making a community punishment order, when the offender is under 21 years old, or before attaching conditions for medical treatment to a community rehabilitation order. A report is no longer required when an adult is being sentenced to custody.", 'Sentence must be pronounced in open court by the presiding judge and is almost always pronounced in the presence of the accused. The sentence may be altered (or rescinded) within 28 days by the trial court, and the Crown Court also has a further (common-law) power to postpone sentence for more than 28 days when circumstances require this (e.g. when disqualifying from driving under the totting-up provisions, if the driving licence is not available). There is a power to postpone sentence for up to six months (see DEFERRED SENTENCE).', 'Courts have very wide discretionary powers of sentencing in all crimes (except murder and treason). The penalties prescribed by law are maximum penalties, to be imposed in the most serious cases, and the judge must decide what is the appropriate sentence in each case. However, the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 introduces automatic minimum sentences for second-time violent offenders (see REPEAT OFFENDER) and for persistent burglars (see BURGLARY) and dealers in hard drugs (see CONTROLLED DRUGS). Judges may give a lesser sentence for burglary and drug dealing if the court considers the minimum would be unjust in all the circumstances.

Magistrates' courts have less extensive powers of sentencing, but may sometimes, upon convicting an offender, remit him to the Crown Court for sentence (e.g.when he has been tried summarily for an offence triable either way). They are not empowered to sentence first offenders to imprisonment unless satisfied there is no other appropriate way of dealing with them. There is usually a right of appeal against sentence to the Court of Appeal. The Attorney General may refer cases to the Court of Appeal (with its permission) when Crown Court sentences appear unduly lenient.

"service law":
[['', [["The law that regulates the conduct of members of the armed forces. It consists of naval law, military law, and air-force law (military law is the branch relating to the army, but the expression is frequently used to describe all three branches). Its primary sources are the Naval Discipline Act 1957, the Army Act 1955, and the Air Force Act 1955; supplementary sources are Admiralty Instructions and the Queen's Regulations both for the Army and for the Royal Air Force. The three Acts concerned require annual renewal. Every fifth year an Armed Forces Act enables them to continue in force for one year and provides that for each of the following four years they may be continued in force by an Order in Council that has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament (the last such Act was the Armed Forces Act 2001, which applies from 11 May 2001). The purpose of this procedure (which did not apply to the Naval Discipline Act 1957until this was provided by the Armed Forces Act 1971) is to ensure that Parliament has an annual opportunity of debating matters relating to the armed forces.", "Service law is a specialized code of criminal law. Its essential concern is the maintenance of discipline and it embodies a variety of offences (including desertion, malingering, and insubordination) that have no counterpart in the ordinary criminal law. Since 1 April 1997it has been an offence against service law to refuse to take a service compulsory drug test; in addition, the service authorities have been empowered to take fingerprints or DNA samples from those convicted of service offences, for criminal records purposes. Commanding officers have powers of dealing with minor offences summarily and, with effect from 2 October 2000,a member of the armed forces may appeal against the commanding officer's finding and/or award to a Summary Appeal Court. The Summary Appeal Court, consisting of a judge advocate and two officers, may uphold, quash, or vary the commanding officer's finding or award. But the tribunals primarily responsible for the trial and punishment of offences are the courts martial. Service law applies to a member of the armed forces wherever he may be. In the UK he is subject both to service law and to the ordinary criminal law. When he is not in the UK,the ordinary criminal law does not in general apply to him; the relevant Acts therefore provide that it is an offence under service law for any serviceman to do anything that constitutes an offence under the ordinary criminal law. The effect of this general provision is to create, in the case of a member of the armed forces who is in the UK, a duality of offences. If, for example, a soldier in the UK steals, he commits an offence against both the ordinary criminal law and service law. He cannot, however, be punished under both.", 'Although service law applies primarily to members of the armed forces, certain classes of civilians are also subject to it. These include civilians employed outside the UK within the limits of the command of any officer commanding a body of the regular forces and the families of members of the armed forces residing with them outside the UK.The inclusion of the latter has had the effect of extending the jurisdiction of courts martial to cases with which they are manifestly not equipped to deal. This has led to the establishment of standing civilian courts.']]]],

The importance of the distinction between a set-off and a counterclaim arises principally in relation to costs when both parties are successful. If the defendant's plea is a set-off, the claimant will recover the amount of his claim less the amount set off, and in the county court, the costs will normally be calculated in relation to the net sum recovered.

[['', [["Land that is the subject of a settlement under the Settled Land Act 1925,i.e.land in which two or more beneficial interests exist in succession to one another or land that is subject to certain other fetters on the owner's powers. No such settlements can be created after 1996; most of the arrangements described below can now exist as trusts of land with the exception of entailed interests, which can no longer be created. Existing settlements continue until coming naturally to an end. The categories were as follows. (1) Land held in trust for any persons by way of succession; for example, in trust for A for life then Bfor life then C in fee simple. (2) Entailed interests. (3)Land owned subject to a gift over on a specified event. (4)Land owned for a determinable interest. (5) Land conveyed to a person under 18 years (a minor cannot own or convey a legal estate in land). (6)Land in which a future interest may come into possession on a specified event. For example, when land is left to A and B provided they respectively attain the age of 18, the elder is absolutely entitled to a half share on reaching 18 but may become entitled to the whole of the land absolutely if the younger dies during minority. (7) Land charged voluntarily (i.e. without consideration) or in consideration of marriage or by way of family arrangement with payment of any rentcharge or capital sum; for example, when the owner charges his land with payment of income to his wife during her life or widowhood.", "A settlement made during the life of the settlor was effected by a trust instrument and a vesting deed. The trust instrument declared the beneficial interests in the land and appointed two or more individuals, or a trust corporation (e.g.a bank), as trustees of the settlement (see SETTLED LAND ACT TRUSTEES). The vesting deed transferred the legal estate in the settled land to the immediate beneficiary; it also had to identify the trustees of the settlement. A will that effected a settlement constituted the trust instrument; the legal estate devolved upon the testator's personal representatives on trust to vest it, by deed or assent, in the immediate beneficiary. When the legal estate could not be transferred to the immediate beneficiary (e.g.because he was under 18), it had to be vested in a statutory owner.", 'The purpose of the Act was to balance the protection of beneficiaries with future interests against the principle that the person immediately entitled in possession should not be prevented by the existence of future interests from prudently managing and dealing with the land. Thus the Act conferred on the immediate beneficiary powers to sell the land at the best price reasonably obtainable, to exchange it for other land, and to grant certain leases (up to 50 years, or 100 years for mining, or 999 years for building or forestry). These transactions overreached the interests of the subsequent beneficiaries, who acquired corresponding interests in the capital money or income arising from them. The immediate beneficiary could also mortgage the land to raise money to payoff other encumbrances, to give equality of value on an exchange, and to pay for certain improvements. He could insist that the cost of certain improvements (such as rebuilding the principal mansion house and installation of drainage and electricity) be paid out of capital. His statutory powers could be extended by the terms of the settlement but could not be excluded or restricted. The Act imposed on the immediate beneficiary, in exercising these powers, the duties of a trustee for all parties having a beneficial interest in the land. The beneficiary thus had a dual role. When the immediate beneficiary sold or otherwise disposed of settled land, the vesting deed formed the basis of his title. The purchaser was not concerned with the interests of beneficiaries whose rights are overreached (see CURTAIN PROVISIONS) but had to pay the price to the trustees of the settlement or, at the direction of the immediate beneficiary (the tenant for life or the person exercising the powers of the tenant for life), into court.']]]],

Their consent is also necessary before the immediate beneficiary can validly exercise certain of his statutory powers; for example, to sell the principal mansion house or timber cut from the land if the settlement so requires or to vary rights (such as easements) over other land that benefit the settled land.', "The trustees are generally appointed by the trust instrument but must be named in the vesting deed. If no trustees are appointed, the Settled Land Act 1925 provides that they will be either (1) trustees having a power of sale of other land comprised in the settlement and held on similar trusts; (2) trustees having a future power of sale of the settled land; (3) persons appointed by the beneficiaries if they are of full age and entitled to dispose of the whole settled estate; or (4) the settlor's personal representatives, when the settlement is effected by will.

Severance may be effected, for example, by mutual agreement of the joint tenants, by the bankruptcy of one of them, by sale of the land or of one joint tenant's interest, or by written notice to the other joint tenants. It is not possible to sever a legal joint tenancy, since a tenancy in common cannot exist as a legal estate. Any words in a conveyance of land to two or more people that show an intention that they take separate shares will be construed as words of severance creating an equitable tenancy in common, rather than a joint tenancy.", '2. The separation of the good parts of a contract from the bad, which are rejected. The doctrine of severance applies to any contract which contains clauses that are void by statute or common law, or even, in some cases, illegal, provided there are no public policy grounds against severing (see VOID CONTRACT). The courts will, if possible, save the contract from total invalidity by severing the offending part and the rest of the contract will stand under what is known as the "blue pencil" test.

The Equal Pay Act 1970forbids having different terms for men and women in their contracts of employment (see also EQUAL PAY). The Sex Discrimination Act 1975(asamended by the Sex Discrimination Act 1986)goes further, prohibiting discrimination when offering a contract of employment and before entering into such a contract. It also prohibits discrimination in employment on the grounds of marital status and discrimination in partnerships with six or more partners, trade unions, qualifying or authorizing bodies, vocational training, and education. The Act provides for special exceptions; for example, when male or female characteristics are a genuine requirement of the job. It is also unlawful to victimize someone who has complained of illegal discrimination. The Act covers both direct and indirect discrimination. The latter includes making conditions that apply to both sexes but in such a way that, for instance, the proportion of women who can fulfil the conditions is considerably less than men. An example would be insisting on a record of continuous service for promotion, which is far more difficult for women to satisfy because of pregnancy and motherhood.

Because an incorporated company is in law a separate entity from the company membership, it is possible to divide and sell that entity in specified units (see (NOMINAL) CAPITAL). In the case of a company limited by shares (see LIMITED COMPANY) the liability of shareholders is confined to the purchase price of the shares. Once purchased, these units of the company become intangible property in their own right and can be bought and sold as an activity distinct from the trading activities of the company in question. While the company is a going concern, shares carry rights in relation to voting and sharing profits (see DIVIDEND). When a limited company is wound up the shareholders have rights to share in the assets after debts have been paid. If there are no such assets shareholders lose the amount of their investment but are not liable for the company's debts (see FRAUDULENT TRADING; WRONGFUL TRADING).", 'Preference shares usually carry a right to a fixed percentage dividend, e.g. 10% of the nominal value (see AUTHORIZED CAPITAL), before ordinary shareholders receive anything and holders also have the right to the return of the nominal value of their shares before ordinary shareholders (but after creditors). Holders of participating preference shares have further rights to share surplus profits or assets with the ordinary shareholders. Preference shares are generally cumulative, i.e. if no dividend is declared in one year, holders are entitled to arrears when eventually one is paid. Usually preference shareholders can vote only when their class rights are being varied.', 'Ordinary shares constitute the risk capital (also called equity capital), as they carry no prior rights in relation to dividends or return of nominal value. However, the rights they do carry are unlimited in extent: if the company is successful, the ordinary shareholders are not restricted to a fixed dividend (unlike the preference shareholders) and the high yield upon their shares will cause these to increase in value. Similarly, if there are surplus assets on a winding-up, the ordinary shareholders will take what is left after the preference shareholders have been satisfied. Because ordinary shareholders carry the risk of the enterprise, they generally have full voting rights in a general meeting (though some companies issue nonvoting ordinary shares to raise additional capital without diluting the control of the company).', 'Redeemable shares are issued subject to the proviso that they will or may be bought back (at the option of the shareholder or the company) by the company.

In many countries the executive, legislative, and judicial powers of sovereignty are exercised by different bodies.

A police officer may require a specimen of blood if he reasonably believes that he cannot demand a breath specimen for medical reasons, if an approved and reliable device for taking a breath specimen is unavailable or cannot be used, or if the defendant is suspected of being unfit to drive and a doctor believes that his condition is due to a drug. A police officer may also ask for a blood specimen if the suspect is in hospital (subject to the consent of the doctor treating him). A suspect may be asked to give a blood specimen under these conditions even if he has already given a breath specimen.', "A blood specimen may only be taken with the defendant's consent and by a medical practitioner, otherwise it cannot be used as evidence in any proceedings.

The specimen may be required whenever the police are investigating any of these offences, but only if the suspect is at the police station. Usually he will have been brought to the station under arrest as a result of a positive breath test or refusal to undergo such a test. It is an offence not to provide a specimen without a reasonable excuse, and the police officer should warn a suspect of this when asking for the specimen. This offence is punishable by fine or imprisonment, endorsement (which carries 10 penalty points under the totting-up system), and discretionary disqualification (in cases of being in charge of a vehicle) or compulsory disqualification (in cases of driving or attempting to drive).', "The suspect must give two breath specimens, which should be measured by means of an approved electronic device (not the breathalyser used for the preliminary breath test) that automatically prints out the level of alcohol in the breath. A print-out of the lower of the two readings is used as evidence in a subsequent trial, together with a signed certificate by a police officer that it refers to the defendant's specimen given at the stated time. The defendant must be given a copy of these documents at least seven days before his trial, and he may serve notice not later than three days before the trial that he requires the police officer who signed it to attend the hearing. At his trial, a defendant may bring evidence to show that he drank more alcohol between the time of the alleged offence and giving the specimen and that this accounted for his exceeding the prescribed limit. It is an offence, however, to deliberately drink more alcohol in order to make it difficult to prove his guilt.", 'Once a suspect has given a specimen he is free to leave the police station, but the police may detain him if they reasonably suspect that he is likely to continue driving with an excess alcohol level or while unfit to drive. Under certain circumstances the suspect can provide either a specimen of blood or a specimen of urine instead of a breath specimen. If the breath specimen records a reading of more than 35 but less than 50 micrograms of alcohol per 100 ml of breath (and prosecution is intended), the suspect is entitled to ask that it should be replaced by a blood or urine specimen.']]]],
"specimen of urine":
[['', [['A specimen of urine for analysis, used as an alternative to a specimen of breath in cases involving drunken driving.

A person cannot be convicted of a speeding offence on the evidence of one witness alone, but the evidence of a single police officer reading his speedometer may be enough to secure a conviction. Speeding may itself be evidence of careless and inconsiderate driving or dangerous driving, but it is an offence in its own right even if it caused no danger and the driver was not in any way at fault. Speeding offences are subject to the requirement of a notice of intended prosecution.']]]],
"spent conviction":
[['', [["A conviction that, after a specified number of years known as the rehabilitation period, may in all subsequent civil proceedings be treated as if it had never existed. The length of the rehabilitation period depends on the gravity of the offence, and some convictions are not subject to rehabilitation (e.g.when the sentence was life imprisonment). Dismissal from a job on the grounds of an undisclosed spent conviction may amount to unfair dismissal. Similarly, to deny that one has been convicted if the conviction is spent does not amount to perjury or deception. Malicious publication of statements about a person's spent convictions can make the publisher liable for defamation, even if the statements are true. The provisions relating to spent convictions do not apply in criminal proceedings, but counsel and the court should, as far as possible, avoid referring to a spent conviction and references to it in open court may only be made with express leave of the judge in the interests of justice.

[['', [["Persistent threatening behaviour by one person against another. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997creates two offences relating to stalking. If the harasser's behaviour makes the victim fear for his or her safety, the maximum penalty is five years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. When the behaviour does not lead to a fear of violence but does cause distress, the maximum penalty is six months in prison and/or a fine of up to ￡5000.The behaviour must have taken place on more than one occasion and the prosecution must show that a reasonable person would realize that the behaviour would have the effect of causing the victim to fear violence or feel harassed. Both offences are immediately arrestable without a warrant, and the police have power to search the harasser's property. The courts may make a restraining order immediately after convicting a person of either of the two offences. In Scotland the common law has always provided protection against stalking through the offence of breach of the peace. See also MOLESTATION."]]]],

Documents that are insufficiently or improperly stamped cannot be admitted as evidence in civil proceedings and they are therefore legally unenforceable. Documents must be sent for stamping within certain time limits to avoid incurring penalties. Stamp duty is controlled by the Inland Revenue. Stamp duty is payable on all transfers of land at 0% up to and including a value of ￡60,000; 1% if the value of the transfer is over ￡60,000but not more than ￡250,000, 3%on transfers over ￡250,000but less than ￡500,000, and 4% above ￡500,000.

[['', [['n. See ACT OF PARLIAMENT.']]], ['statute', [["A document that sets out legal rules and has (normally) been passed by both Houses of Parliament in the form of a Bill and agreed to by the Crown (see ROYAL ASSENT). Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, however, passing of public Bills by the House of Lords can be dispensed with, except in the case of Bills to extend the duration of Parliament or to confirm provisional orders. Subject to these exceptions, the Lords can delay Bills passed by the House of Commons; it cannot block them completely. If the Commons pass a money Bill (for example, one giving effect to the Budget) and the Lords do not pass it unaltered within one month, it may be submitted direct for the royal assent. Any other Bill may receive the royal assent without being passed by the Lords if the Commons pass it in two consecutive sessions and at least one year elapses between its second reading in the first session and its third reading in the second. Every modern Act of Parliament begins with a long title, which summarizes its aims, and ends with a short title, by which it may be cited in any other document. The short title includes the calendar year in which the Act receives the royal assent (e.g. The Competition Act 1998). An alternative method of citation is by the calendar year together with the Chapter number allotted to the Act on receiving the assent or, in the case of an Act earlier than 1963, by its regnal year or years and Chapter number. Regnal years are numbered from the date of a sovereign's accession to the throne, and an Act is attributed to the year or years covering the session in which it receives the royal assent. (See alsoENACTING WORDS.) An Act comes into force on the date of royal assent unless it specifies a different date or provides for the date to be fixed by ministerial order. Acts of Parliament are classified by the Queen's Printer as public general Acts, local Acts, and personal Acts. Public general Acts include all Acts (except those confirming provisional orders) introduced into Parliament as public Bills. LocalActs comprise all Acts introduced as private Bills and confined in operation to a particular area, together with Acts confirming provisional orders. Personal Acts are Acts introduced as private Bills and applying to private individuals or estates. Acts are alternatively classified as public Acts or private Acts according to their status in courts of law. A public Act is judicially noticed (i.e. accepted by the courts as a matter of general knowledge). A private Act is not, and must be expressly pleaded by the person relying on it. All Acts since 1850are public unless they specifically provide otherwise. The printed version of an Act, rather than the version set out on the HMSOwebsite, is the authentic text, although there are current proposals (2001) to alter this rule under the Electronic Communications Act 2000."]]]],

Regulations or orders made before the 1946 Act came into force may still be statutory instruments if the power they exercise was a power to make statutory rules within the meaning of pre-existing legislation, which was duly conferred on a rule-making authority under that legislation.', 'The 1946 Act relates in part to the publicity to be given to statutory instruments, requiring them to be numbered, printed, and published by the Queen\'s printer. They are numbered consecutively for each calendar year in the order in which the printer receives them; for example, the first statutory instrument to be received in 1993would be cited as "S.1. 1993No.1". Moreover, as a modification of the rule ignorantia juris non excusat (ignorance of the law is no excuse), the Act makes nonpublication a defence to proceedings for contravening a statutory instrument unless other adequate steps had been taken to bring it to the public notice. The Act is also concerned with certain aspects of parliamentary control. It standardizes negative resolution procedure for statutory instruments by providing that, if the enabling statute simply makes them subject to annulment by resolution of either House of Parliament, they are to be laid before Parliament for 40 days and liable to annulment during that period. It further provides that any statutory instrument required to be laid (either because of that rule or because the enabling statute expressly says so) must be laid before becoming operative unless there is good reason to the contrary (in which case, an explanation must be given to the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker).

These rights are governed by a 1958Geneva Convention, which is taken to represent the position under customary international law. New rules were proposed in a 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (see LAW OF THE SEA). A coastal state exercises sovereignty over its territorial waters, which includes, in particular, the following. (1) An exclusive right to fish and to exploit the resources of the seabed and subsoil of the seabed and exclusive use of the airspace above the territorial sea. (2)The exclusive right to use the territorial waters to transport people and goods from one part of the state to another. (3)The right to enact laws concerning navigation, immigration, customs dues, and health, which bind all foreign ships. (4)The right to ask a warship that ignores navigation regulations to leave the territorial waters. (5) Certain powers of arrest over merchant ships and people on board and jurisdiction to try crimes committed on board such ships within the territorial waters. (6)The right to exclude fighting in the territorial waters during a war in which the coastal state is neutral. All foreign ships, however, have a right of innocent passage through the territorial sea, i.e. the right to pass through, provided they do not prejudice the peace, security, or good order of the coastal state (submarines must navigate on the surface). See also HOT PURSUIT, RIGHT OF.', "The extent of the territorial sea is usually measured from the low-tide mark on the shore, but in estuaries and small bays it is measured from a closing line between two points on the shore, which delimits the state's internal waters. The width of the territorial sea is a matter of dispute in international law. Traditionally it has been fixed at 3 nautical miles (see CANNON-SHOT RULE), but many states have claimed 12 miles or more, and this will probably become the normal width. The Territorial SeaAct 1987fixes the territorial waters of the UKat 12nautical miles. Beyond the territorial sea, states have a contiguous zone, not exceeding 24 nautical miles, in which they may exercise jurisdiction over certain infringements of their customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary regulations. In recent years many states (including the UK) have also claimed exclusive fishery zones extending 200 miles beyond the low-tide mark. The UK is subject to the EU's Common Fisheries Policy in relation to fishing. See alsoEXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE."]]]],

"terrorism":
[['', [['n. The use or threat of violence for political ends, including putting the public in fear.

The Terrorism Act 2000 defines terrorism in section 1 as (a) the use or threat of action that involves serious violence against a person or serious damage to property, endangers a person\'s life, creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, or is designed to interfere with or disrupt an electronic system, or (b) the use or threat of violence designed to influence the government or intimidate the public or a section of the public: in both cases the use or threat of such action or violence is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause. The Act also provides that the action referred to includes that taken within as well as outside the United Kingdom. The Act contains provisions that allow for certain organizations to be declared as proscribed organizations. It then becomes an offence to be a member of such an organization. The Act also contains detailed provisions as to property defined as being "terrorist property" and the forfeiture of such property. There are detailed provisions relating to the investigation of terrorist activities that grant the police and security services special and extra powers. These include special powers to stop and search, detain, and interrogate those suspected of involvement in terrorist activities.', 'The Act was a further attempt at bringing UK legislation into line with the 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. This was needed in order to ensure that persons within the UKwho were suspected of terrorist activity in other parts of Europe could be successfully extradited to face trial in those other states. Much of the legislation is directed at the situation in Northern Ireland. However, this is likely to change as the focus now shifts to dealing with international terrorism.']]]],

"theft":
[['', [['n. The dishonest appropriation of property belonging to someone else with the intention of keeping it permanently (see DISHONESTY). "Appropriation" is defined in the Theft Act 1968as the assumption of the rights of the owner of the property and includes any act showing that one is treating the property as one\'s own, which need not necessarily involve taking it away. For example, switching price tags from one item to another in a shop to enable one to buy goods at a lower price could amount to an appropriation, as could purporting to sell someone else\'s property. If a person acquires property without stealing it, but later decides to keep the property unlawfully, he may be regarded as having appropriated it. For example, if A lends his golf clubs to Bfor a week and B subsequently decides to keep the clubs or sell them, this indicates that B has assumed the rights of the owner unlawfully. "Property" includes all tangible and intangible objects and choses in action (e.g. bank balances) but there are special rules in the Theft Act 1968 governing land and wild plants and animals (see POACHING). Property belongs to anyone who either owns it or has physical possession or control of it. The Act expressly states that a person is not dishonest if he believes (even if unreasonably) that he is legally entitled to appropriate the property or that the owner would consent or could not be discovered by taking reasonable steps. The punishment for theft is up to ten years\' imprisonment.', 'Under the Theft Act 1978, obtaining goods or services without paying for them is now covered by the offence of making off without payment (see also SHOPLIFTING).

"tort":
[['', [['n. [Old French: harm, wrong: from Latin tortus, twisted or crooked] A wrongful act or omission for which damages can be obtained in a civil court by the person wronged, other than a wrong that is only a breach of contract. The law of tort is mainly concerned with providing compensation for personal injury and property damage caused by negligence. It also protects other interests, however, such as reputation (see DEFAMATION), personal freedom (see ASSAULT; FALSE IMPRISONMENT), title to property (see CONVERSION; TRESPASS), enjoyment of property (see NUISANCE), and commercial interests (see INTIMIDATION; CONSPIRACY; PASSING OFF). It must usually be shown that the wrong was done intentionally or negligently, but there are some torts of strict liability. Most torts are actionable only if they have caused damage, but torts whose main function is to protect rights rather than to compensate for damage (such as trespass) are actionable without proof of damage. The person principally liable is the one who committed the tort (the tortfeasor) but under the rules of vicarious liability one may be liable for a tort committed by another person. The main remedy for a tort is an action for damages, but in some cases an injunction can be obtained to prevent repetition of the injury. Other remedies are self-help and orders for specific restitution of property.', 'Some torts are also breaches of contract. Negligent driving by a taxi-driver that causes injury to his passenger is both the tort of negligence and breach of the contract to carry the passenger safely to his destination. The passenger may sue either in tort or for breach of contract, or both. Many torts are also crimes. Assault is both a crime and a tort. Dangerous driving is a crime and may give rise to an action in tort if it causes injury to another person. The crime is prosecuted by agents of the state in the name of the Crown. It is left to the injured person to seek compensation from the wrongdoer by means of an action in tort.']]]],

However, the prohibition on torture as set out in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights is now part of UK law as a consequence of the Human Rights Act.

"totting up":
[['', [['The system under which offences endorsed on a driving licence are added up to empower the courts to order disqualification from driving. Until 1 November 1982, certain road offences (listed in a Schedule to the Road Traffic Act 1972) were totted up if, within three years before committing the latest offence, the accused had been convicted and had his licence endorsed on two occasions. Since that date the system has been altered. All traffic offences that are subject to compulsory or discretionary disqualification are now assigned a number of penalty points (reflecting the gravity of the offence). When a person is convicted of any of these offences, and his licence is endorsed but he is not disqualified, the endorsement states the number of points for that offence. If he is disqualified for the offence, the penalty points that would normally apply to that offence are not endorsed. When the penalty points endorsed within the past three years -together with the points acquired on the latest offence amount to 12 or more, the court must order disqualification for a minimum of six months, but the points applying to the latest offence are not endorsed. If the accused has already been disqualified within the three years before the latest endorsable conviction, the minimum disqualification is for one year; if he has been disqualified more than once, the minimum is two years. Mitigating circumstances are still permitted (to prevent disqualification or shorten the period), but only upon proof of exceptional hardship. When several offences are committed together, the licence is only endorsed with the points relating to the gravest offence. If a person is disqualified under this system, all previous points are eliminated, and he gets back a clean licence after disqualification. Under the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Act 1995, with effect from 1 June 1997, if a driver is convicted of an endorsable offence and accumulates 6 or more penalty points within two years of passing a driving test, his licence is revoked and he must retake the test. Penalty points for the most important offences are as follows.', '3-11 points-any offence involving obligatory disqualification for which disqualification was not ordered because of special reasons or mitigating circumstances.', '10 points -being in charge when unfit or with excess alcohol in the body (see DRUNKEN DRlVING); failing to provide a specimen of breath.', '5-10 points -failing to stop after a road traffic accident; failing to report an accident.', '3-9 points -careless and inconsiderate driving.', '8 points- taking a conveyance.', '6-8 points -driving without insurance.', '7 points- driving while disqualified.', '4 points -failing to provide a specimen for a preliminary breath test.', '3 points-speeding (if a fixed penalty); leaving a car in a dangerous position (see OBSTRUCTION).', '2 points -driving without a licence; driving under age.', 'All endorsements on the licence before 1 November 1982 count as 3 points.']]]],

The background to control is the development plan. Councils formulate and keep under review structure plans of general policy for their areas, and the other authorities maintain local plans of detailed policy for theirs. The structure plan and local plan for an area constitute its development plan. The machinery of control is planning permission, without which no development of land may take place. The Secretary of State has granted permission for certain classes of development ("permitted development") by a general development order applicable throughout England and Wales; permission may be granted for particular cases by special development orders. In all other cases permission is a matter for local planning authorities (normally at district or borough level), with a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against its refusal or against conditions attached to it. The implementation of control is by local planning authorities, primarily by serving an enforcement notice.']]]],

Under terms of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992,a person cannot be sued in tort for an act that is committed in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute on the grounds that it induces or threatens any breach or interference with the performance of a contract. Generally such immunity extends only to the acts of employees against their own employer. Secondary industrial action may be unlawful when it is directed against an employer who is neither a party to the dispute nor the customer or supplier of the employer in dispute (see also PICKETING). Moreover, there is no immunity in respect of action taken to enforce a closed-shop agreement.", "The 1992Act gives similar immunity to trade unions for their acts committed in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute provided the act concerned is authorized by a majority vote in favour of the action in a secret ballot of the union's members. A trade union member can obtain a court order preventing industrial action being taken if it has not been authorized by a ballot. When the immunity does not apply, a union is only liable in respect of action that has been authorized or endorsed by a responsible person (which includes the principal executive committee, general secretary, president, paid officials, or committees to whom they report). The president, general secretary, or principal executive committee may repudiate such authorization or endorsement provided they act promptly and notify the person giving the authorization or endorsement in writing and without delay.", "When a trade union's immunity does not apply and it is ordered to pay damages (other than for causing personal injury or for breach of duty concerning the ownership control or use of property, or for products liability under the Consumer Protection Act 1987), the amount awarded may not exceed specified limits. These range from ￡10,000 for a union with under 5000 members to ￡250,000for a union with 100000 or more members, and the limits may be varied by statutory instrument. Payment of damages awarded against a trade union or employers' association may not be enforced against certain protected property, including its political and pension funds and the personal assets of its trustees, members, or paid officials, as distinct from assets they hold for the union's or association's purposes."]]]],

Any person or firm that has a trade connection with the goods may register a trade mark. For example, he may be the manufacturer, a dealer, importer, or retailer. Under the Trade Marks Act 1994(and EU directive 89/104), registration is initially for ten years; it is then renewable. Trade marks can be registered for ever. However, the right to remain on the register may be lost if the trade mark is not used or is misused. The owner of a trade mark may assign it or allow others to use it. If anyone uses a registered trade mark without the owner's permission, or uses a mark that is likely to be confused with a registered trade mark, the owner can sue for an injunction and damages or an account of profits. Unregistered marks are protected by passing off. Since 1 April 1996 Community Trade Marks can now be obtained. These are cheaper than trade marks obtained by registration in several individual EU states. Trade marks are an example of intellectual property."]]]],

Under medieval law they belonged to the Crown, but only if it could be proved at a coroner's inquest that the owner had intended to retrieve the items and had not merely abandoned them. If the items were lost or abandoned, the finder acquired a right to possess them. The Treasure Act 1996 (in force from September 1997) altered the law in this field; the Act and the Code of Practice made under it apply only to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The definition of treasure now includes any object at least 300 years old and containing more than 5% precious metal (excluding single coins). The Crown is now entitled to receive all treasure and will pay a reward to the finder. The Act creates a new offence of failing to report the discovery of treasure, with a maximum penalty of a ￡5000 fine or three months' imprisonment (or both). The Code of Practice sets out guidelines on such matters as which objects should be reported; how finders can seek advice from museums and archaeologists in the event of a large find; government policy on the payment of ex gratia rewards, including rewards to landowners and rewards for finds resulting from trespass; and policy and procedures for reaching valuations, including the commissioning of reports from independent experts and provisions for finders to submit their own valuations."]]]],

"treaty":
[['', [['n. An international agreement in writing between two states (a bilateral treaty) or a number of states (a multilateral treaty). Such agreements can also be known as conventions, pacts, protocols, final acts, arrangements, and general acts. Treaties are binding in international law and constitute the equivalent of the municipal-law contract, conveyance, or legislation. Some treaties create law only for those states that are parties to them, some codify pre-existing customary international law, and some propound rules that eventually develop into customary international law, binding upon all states (e.g.the Genocide Convention). Federal states, colonial states, and public international organizations are sometimes also able to enter into treaty obligations. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) defines in detail the rules relating to inter-state treaties and is itself generally considered to declare or develop customary international law in this area. Treaties are normally concluded by the process of ratification.

"trespass":
[['', [["n. A wrongful direct interference with another person or with his possession of land or goods. In the middle ages, any wrongful act was called a trespass, but only some trespasses, such as trespass by force and arms (viet armis), were dealt with in the King's Courts. The distinguishing feature of trespass in modern law is that it is a direct and immediate interference with person or property, such as striking a person, entering his land, or taking away his goods without his consent. Indirect or consequential injury, such as leaving an unlit hole into which someone falls, is not trespass. Trespass is actionable per se, i.e. the act of trespass is itself a tort and it is not necessary to prove that it has caused actual damage.", 'There are three kinds of trespass: to the person, to goods, and to land. Trespassto the person may be intentional or negligent, but since negligent physical injuries are remedied by an action for negligence, the action for trespass to the person is now only brought for intentional acts, in the form of actions for assault, "battery, and false imprisonment. Trespassto goods includes touching, moving, or carrying them away (de bonisasportatis). It may be intentional or negligent, but inevitable accident is a defence. Trespassto land usually takes the form of entering it without permission. It is no defence to show that the trespass was innocent (e.g.that the trespasser honestly believed that the land belonged to him). Trespass to land or goods is a wrong to possession rather than to ownership. Thus a tenant of rented property, for example, has the right to sue for trespass to that property. Trespass to land is a tort but not normally a crime: the notice "Trespassers will be prosecuted" is therefore usually misleading.', "However, trespass may sometimes constitute a crime. Thus squatters may be guilty of a crime (see ADVERSE OCCUPATION); it is a crime to trespass on diplomatic or consular premises or premises similarly protected by immunity; and it is a crime to enter and remain on any premises as a trespasser with a weapon of offence for which one has no authority or reasonable excuse, or to be on any premises, land, or water as a trespasser with a firearm for which one has no reasonable excuse. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 created the offences of aggravated trespass and collective trespass. The summary offence of aggravated trespass occurs when a trespasser in the open air seeks to intimidate, obstruct, or disrupt a lawful activity, such as hunting; an offender can be arrested and failure to leave the land on the direction of a senior police officer is also an offence. Collective trespass occurs when two or more people are trespassing with the purpose of residing on land belonging to another person. The police have powers to direct collective trespassers to leave if they have caused damage, used threatening or abusive words towards the occupier, or brought six or more vehicles (which may be caravans) onto the land (see alsoUNAUTHORIZED CAMPING). Failure to leave or re-entry within three months is a summary offence for which a uniformed police officer has a power of arrest. Both collective and aggravated trespass are punishable by a fine and/or three months' imprisonment. See also AIRSPACE; BURGLARY; TRESPASSORY ASSEMBLY."]]]],

"trespass by relation":
[['', [["A form of trespass based on the legal fiction that a person's actual possession of land dates from the moment he became entitled to possession. It arose from the rule that only the possessor of land can sue for trespass to it.

A chief office of police may apply to prohibit such an assembly if he reasonably believes it is going to be held. Knowingly organizing or inciting a trespassory assembly are summary offences punishable by a fine on level 4 and/or three months\' imprisonment; knowingly taking part attracts a fine on level 3.

The trust, recognized originally in Chancery, is based on confidence and developed from the use; it has been described as the most important contribution of English equity to jurisprudence. The beneficiary has rights against the trustee and may also have rights over the property in the hands of others (see TRACING TRUST PROPERTY). When a sole beneficiary is 18 or over, sane, and entitled to all the trust Property, he may require the trustees to transfer that property to him; this applies equally when all the beneficiaries are 18 or over, sane, and likewise entitled.

If no trustees are appointed, the Settled Land Act 1925 provides that they will be either (1) trustees having a power of sale of other land comprised in the settlement and held on similar trusts; (2) trustees having a future power of sale of the settled land; (3) persons appointed by the beneficiaries if they are of full age and entitled to dispose of the whole settled estate; or (4) the settlor's personal representatives, when the settlement is effected by will.

"ultra vires":
[['', [['[Latin: beyond the powers] Describing an act by a public authority, company, or other body that goes beyond the limits of the powers conferred on it. Ultra viresacts are invalid (compare INTRA VlRES). The ultra vires doctrine applies to all powers, whether created by statute or by a private document or agreement (such as a trust deed or contract of agency). In the field of public (especially administrative) law it governs the validity of all delegated and subdelegated legislation. This is ultra vires not only if it contains provisions not authorized by the enabling power but also if it does not comply with any procedural requirements regulating the exercise of the power. Subdelegated legislation that is within the terms of the delegated legislation authorizing it may still be invalid if the power to make that legislation did not include the power to subdelegate (see DELEGATUS NON POTEST DELEGARE). The individual can normally establish the invalidity of delegated or subdelegated legislation by raising the point as a defence in proceedings against him for contravening it. The doctrine also governs the validity of decisions made by inferior courts or administrative or domestic tribunals and the validity of the exercise of any administrative power. The decision of a court or tribunal is ultra vires if it exceeds jurisdiction, contravenes procedural requirements, or disregards the rules of natural justice (the power conferring jurisdiction being construed as requiring the observance of these). The exercise of an administrative power is ultra vires not only if unauthorized in substance, but equally if (for example) it is procedurally irregular, improperly motivated, or in breach of the rules of natural justice. The remedies available for this second aspect of the doctrine are quashing orders, prohibition orders, declaration, and injunction (the first two of these are public remedies, not available against decisions of domestic tribunals whose jurisdiction is based solely on contract).', "Acts by a registered company are ultra vires if they exceed the objects clause of the memorandum of association. A company member can restrain such acts prior to performance; thereafter they are treated as valid (though they may be a breach of directors' duties). Section 35 of the Companies Act 1985(as amended in 1989) made it much harder to challenge ultra vires acts of a company."]]]],

In a members' voluntary winding-up, the directors must make a statutory declaration of solvencywithin the five weeks preceding the resolution. This declaration states that the directors have investigated the affairs of the company and are of the opinion that the company will be able to pay its debts in full within a specified period, not exceeding 12 months from the date of the resolution. The liquidator is appointed by the company members. A creditors' voluntary winding-up arises when no declaration of solvency has been made or when the liquidator in a members' voluntary winding-up disagrees with the forecast made by the directors.", "In these circumstances the company must hold a meeting of its creditors and lay before it a statement of affairs disclosing its assets and liabilities. A liquidator may be nominated by the company and by the creditors; the creditors' nominee is preferred unless the court orders otherwise. If the company nominee acts as liquidator prior to the creditors' meeting he can only exercise his powers with the consent of the court. The creditors can also appoint a liquidation committee.", 'In both types of voluntary winding-up the powers of the directors are restricted after the resolution for voluntary winding-up has been passed and they cease when a liquidator has been appointed.']]]],

"war":
[['', [['n. The legal state of affairs that exists when states use force to vindicate rights or settle disputes between themselves. States can engage in hostilities (e.g.reprisals} without being in a technical state of war, and they can be in a state of war without much fighting taking place. At common law a state of war could not exist until there had been a formal declaration of war or commencement of hostilities by the Crown. The legal condition of war automatically terminates diplomatic relations and certain types of treaties between the participants. Normal intercourse and commerce between British subjects and those of a power with which the Crown is at war are prohibited.', 'In the Kellogg-Briand Pact (also known as the Pact of Paris) of 1928,the contracting parties renounced war as an instrument of national policy and undertook to settle their disputes by peaceful means. The United Nations Charter declares that all parties to it "shall refrain...from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state" or in a manner inconsistent with the Charter, and this is commonly accepted as an accurate statement of customary international law. Nonetheless it appears that states still retain a right of self-defence, at least if they have been the victims of armed attack and until the Security Council can act. The Security Council is also authorized to use force (or to call upon states to do so) under certain circumstances in order to protect the peace, although in practice this power has not been invoked (see USE OF FORCE). The right of self-defence includes a collective right to assist other states acting in self-defence.', 'The Hague Conventions and Geneva Conventions provide rules governing the conduct of wars and stating the rights and duties of both combatants and noncombatants during war. However, they do not deal with all aspects of warfare or all types of war. There have also been various specific conventions governing particular issues, including a 1972 convention on the use or possession of bacteriological and toxic weapons, a 1976 convention on the military use of environmental modification techniques, and a 1981 convention and three protocols on cruel or indiscriminate non-nuclear weapons. Civil wars are not usually illegal from the point of view of international law, but it is uncertain whether or not other states may legally help either the insurgents or the established authorities (see BELLIGERENT COMMUNITIES, RECOGNITION INSURGENCY). The 1977First and Second Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 1949,respectively, extend some of the laws of war to civil wars and wars of national liberation (see SELF-DETERMINATION). See also AGGRESSION; HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION; MARTENS CLAUSE; OCCUPATION; OFFENCES AGAINST INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ORDER; WAR CRIMES.']]]],
"war crimes":
[['', [['Any violation of the laws or customs of war amounting to a criminal act. According to the Charter of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal of 1946,war crimes include murder, ill-treatment, or deportation of civilian populations, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war, killing hostages, plundering property, and wanton destruction of population centres or devastation that is not justified by military necessity. The Nuremberg Tribunal also defined a new category of crimes against humanity, consisting essentially of murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population before or during World War 11 and persecution on political, racial, or religious grounds (but only if the persecution is connected with war crimes or crimes against peace); these acts are crimes against humanity whether or not they violate the domestic law of the country where the crime was committed. lt is now arguable that this definition is of general application and is wider than that of war crimes. In consequence, the prohibition of crimes against humanity denies the right of any state to treat its citizens as it pleases. This has had major implications for the relationship between state sovereigntyand humanitarian intervention.', 'The Tribunal also created a third category of crimes against peace, i.e. planning, preparing, or waging a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties. It is generally considered that these definitions now form part of customary international law.', 'War crimes tribunals were established at the end of World War II with jurisdiction to try and punish those who allegedly committed war crimes while acting in the interests of the European Axis countries or Japan. More recently, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council has set up ad hoc war crimes tribunals in relation to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (1993) and Rwanda (1994). See also INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.', "The War Crimes Act 1991 gives jurisdiction to UK courts to try those charged with war crimes committed in German-held territory during World War II, irrespective of the accused's nationality at the time.

"wardship":
[['', [["n. The jurisdiction of the High Court to make a child a ward of court and assume responsibility for its welfare. The jurisdiction is almost unlimited, although subject to consideration of the child's welfare and, to some extent, the rights of other persons and the public interest. The court exercises detailed control of the ward: it may appoint the Official Solicitor to act as his children's guardian and may order either parent to make periodical payments for his maintenance. Wardship proceedings are heard in private and the usual rules of evidence may be relaxed (e.g. in respect of hearsay evidence). The court may enforce its orders by injunction; breach of this or tampering with the ward may constitute contempt of court.", 'Wardship proceedings are usually used (1) when there is a dispute between estranged parents but no divorce proceedings have been started; (2) when a foster parent or potential adopter wishes to prevent relatives interfering with the child or when a third party wishes to remove the child from parents who are considered unfit to have parental responsibility; (3)when a child has been "kidnapped" by a parent; (4)to exercise control over a wayward child; and (5) to control medical treatment, such as sterilization, even when this is contrary to the wishes of the child. Any person who can establish a proper interest in the child may apply for wardship (including the child himself), but the Children Act 1989 restricts the right of local authorities to use wardship proceedings. It also repeals the court\'s power to commit a ward to the care or supervision of a local authority. Since the Children Act came into force use of wardship may be limited as the court may prefer to make a section 8 order instead.']]]],

Letters and other documents headed "without prejudice" cannot be adduced as evidence in any court action without the consent of both parties. However, they may be relevant when costs are discussed in courts -thus the phrase "without prejudice save as to costs" is often added on settlement correspondence. Whether or not a discussion or letter is "without prejudice" and therefore cannot be disclosed to the court depends on whether it was a genuine attempt to settle a dispute, not whether the words "without prejudice" were written on a letter or said in a meeting. The reason such discussions are kept secret from the court is that the courts are keen to encourage settlement of disputes without recourse to the courts, and if settlement discussions could be disclosed it may deter people from settling disputes.']]]],

"witness":
[['', [['n. 1. A person who observes the signing of a legal document in case it is subsequently necessary to verify the authenticity of the signature. He adds his own signature to the document as a witness. Many legal documents are only valid if properly witnessed (see DEED);', "2. A person who gives evidence. In court, witnesses are required either to give evidence on oath or to affirm that their evidence is true. Most people are qualified to give evidence in any case (see COMPETENCE) but there are certain exceptions; for example, when the judge considers the witness mentally unfit to give evidence. In civil cases a child who is too young to understand the nature of an oath is not a competent witness, although in criminal cases a young child may be allowed to give unsworn evidence. There is no minimum age below which a child cannot give evidence, but the judge has a discretion to determine whether or not a child is too young to be a competent witness. Most competent witnesses can be compelled to give evidence (a witness who refuses to answer is in contempt of court) but again there are exceptions. For example, a witness cannot be compelled to answer a question that may incriminate him. A witness's evidence is usually given orally in open court. However in certain circumstances evidence is allowed by affidavit (see COMMISSION) or by video link (see VIDEO EVIDENCE). The evidence of certain witnesses is considered to be unreliable and requires corroboration. The Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 set out new procedures for the issue of witness summonses in summary cases and new rules on formalities in witness statements (effective from 1 April 1997).

Failure to comply with the requirements set out above gives the employee the right to complain to an employment tribunal at any time during the currency of the employment, or within three months of the employment coming to an end. The written statement, although providing evidence of the terms of employment, is not itself the contract of employment.']]]],
"wrong":
[['', [['n. An illegal or immoral act. A distinction must be drawn between moral wrongs and legal wrongs. Some moral wrongs, such as murder or theft, are also crimes punishable by law. But many moral offences are not legal wrongs and some technical legal offences, such as parking offences, are not generally regarded as morally blameworthy. Legal wrongs may be criminal or civil. Crimes are offences against society as a whole, not merely against the victim of the crime. Civil wrongs, such as torts, breaches of contract, and interferences with property rights, are wrongs to the individuals affected.']]]],
"wrongful dismissal":
[['', [["The termination of an employee's contract of employment in a manner that is not in accordance with that contract. Thus when an employee is dismissed without the notice to which he is entitled (in circumstances that do not justify summary dismissal) or when the employer prematurely terminates the employee's fixed-term contract, the employee is entitled to claim damages in the courts or an employment tribunal at common law for wrongful dismissal. The court's jurisdiction concerns only the parties' contractual rights and not their statutory rights under the employment protection legislation (compare UNFAIR DISMISSAL). If a breach of statutory rights arises, an employee may also bring a claim for unfair dismissal. However, this must be done before an employment tribunal."]]]],

"youth court":
[['', [["A magistrates' court exercising jurisdiction over crimes committed by juvenile offenders and other matters relating to children under 18.It was formerly called a juvenile court. The court consists of either three lay magistrates (at least one of whom should normally be a man and one a woman) or a single district judge (magistrates' court) (normally accompanied by a lay magistrate of the opposite sex). All these magistrates are selected from the youth court panel, whose members are thought to be specially qualified to deal with juveniles and who have received additional training for this purpose. The proceedings of the court are not open to the general public, access being very restricted and determined by the Children and Young Persons Act 1933,section 42 (as amended) and by the Home Office and Lord Chancellor's Department Joint Circular on access to youth courts in June 1998. The press may not publish the identity of any juvenile concerned in the court's proceedings unless the court or the Home Secretary so orders, although reporting restrictions are lifted on conviction. Court proceedings are generally more informal than in the magistrates' court for adult offenders, and hearings can be heard in locations other than other court buildings, although generally they will be in existing magistrates' courts. There is a restriction in the timing of a youth court sitting in that it is not permitted within one hour either side of another court sitting. The Narey Report (Home Office 1997) recommended that this restriction be abolished in favour of separate waiting areas for youths and adults accused, to prevent the mixing of the two types of offender."]]]],
